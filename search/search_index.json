A theorists builds a model to describe what patterns of events within a system might generate the experimentalist's data set. With hard work and luck, the two will agree! Events are handled mathematically as 4-vectors. They can be added or subtracted from another, or multiplied by a scalar. Nothing else can be done. A theorist can import very powerful tools to generate patterns, like metrics and group theory. Theorists in physics have been able to construct the most accurate models of nature in all of science. I hope to bring the full power of mathematics down to the level of the events themselves. This may be done by representing events as the mathematical field of quaternions. All the standard tools for creating mathematical patterns - multiplication, trigonometric functions, transcendental functions, infinite series, the special functions of physics - should be available for quaternions. Now a theorist can create patterns of events with events. This may lead to a better unification between the work of a theorist and the work of an experimentalist. An Overview of Doing Physics with Quaternions It has been said that one reason physics succeeds is because all the terms in an equation are tensors of the same rank. This work challenges that assumption, proposing instead an integrated set of equations which are all based on the same 4-dimensional mathematical field of quaternions. Mostly this document shows in cookbook style how quaternion equations are equivalent to approaches already in use. As Feynman pointed out, \"whatever we are allowed to imagine in science must be consistent with everything else we know.\" Fresh perspectives arise because, in essence, tensors of different rank can mix within the same equation. The four Maxwell equations become one nonhomogeneous quaternion wave equation, and the Klein-Gordon equation is part of a quaternion simple harmonic oscillator. There is hope of integrating general relativity with the rest of physics because the affine parameter naturally arises when thinking about lengths of intervals where the origin moves. Since all of the tools used are woven from the same mathematical fabric, the interrelationships become more clear to my eye. Hope you enjoy. A Brief History of Quaternions Complex numbers were a hot subject for research in the early eighteen hundreds. An obvious question was that if a rule for multiplying two numbers together was known, what about multiplying three numbers? For over a decade, this simple question had bothered Hamilton, the big mathematician of his day. The pressure to find a solution was not merely from within. Hamilton wrote to his son: Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month [Oct. 1843] on my coming down to breakfast, your brother William Edwin and yourself used to ask me, 'Well, Papa, can you multiply triplets?' Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of the head, 'No, I can only add and subtract them.' We can guess how Hollywood would handle the Brougham Bridge scene in Dublin. Strolling along the Royal Canal with Mrs. H-, he realizes the solution to the problem, jots it down in a notebook. So excited, he took out a knife and carved the answer in the stone of the bridge. Hamilton had found a long sought-after solution, but it was weird, very weird, it was 4D. One of the first things Hamilton did was get rid of the fourth dimension, setting it equal to zero, and calling the result a \"proper quaternion.\" He spent the rest of his life trying to find a use for quaternions. By the end of the nineteenth century, quaternions were viewed as an oversold novelty. In the early years of this century, Prof. Gibbs of Yale found a use for proper quaternions by reducing the extra fluid surrounding Hamilton's work and adding key ingredients from Rodrigues concerning the application to the rotation of spheres. He ended up with the vector dot product and cross product we know today. This was a useful and potent brew. Our investment in vectors is enormous, eclipsing their place of birth (Harvard had >1000 references under \"vector\", about 20 under \"quaternions\", most of those written before the turn of the century). In the early years of this century, Albert Einstein found a use for four dimensions. In order to make the speed of light constant for all inertial observers, space and time had to be united. Here was a topic tailor-made for a 4D tool, but Albert was not a math buff, and built a machine that worked from locally available parts. We can say now that Einstein discovered Minkowski spacetime and the Lorentz transformation, the tools required to solve problems in special relativity. Today, quaternions are of interest to historians of mathematics. Vector analysis performs the daily mathematical routine that could also be done with quaternions. I personally think that there may be 4D roads in physics that can be efficiently traveled only by quaternions, and that is the path which is laid out in these web pages. In a longer history, Gauss would get the credit for seeing quaternions first in one of his notebooks. Rodrigues developed 3D rotations all on his own also in the 1840's. The Pauli spin matrices and Penrose's spinors are reinventions of the wheel that miss out on division. Although I believe that is a major omission and cause of subtle flaws at the foundations of modern physics, spin matrices and spinors have many more adherents today than quaternions. Multiplying Quaternions the Easy Way Multiplying two complex numbers a + b I and c + d I is straightforward. For two quaternions, b I and d I become the 3-vectors B and D, where B = x I + y J + z K and similarly for D. Multiplication of quaternions is like complex numbers, but with the addition of the cross product. Note that the last term, the cross product, would change its sign if the order of multiplication were reversed (unlike all the other terms). That is why quaternions in general do not commute. If a is the operator d/dt, and B is the del operator, or d/dx I + d/dy J + d/dz K (all partial derivatives), then these operators act on the scalar function c and the 3-vector function D in the following manner: This one quaternion contains the time derivatives of the scalar and 3-vector functions, along with the divergence, the gradient and the curl. Dense notation :-) Inner and Outer Products of Quaternions A good friend of mine has wondered what is means to multiply two quaternions together (this question was a hot topic in the nineteenth century). I care more about what multiplying two quaternions together can do. There are two basic ways to do this: just multiply one quaternion by another, or first take the transpose of one then multiply it with the other. Each of these products can be separated into two parts: a symmetric (inner product) and an antisymmetric (outer product) components. The symmetric component will remain unchanged by exchanging the places of the quaternions, while the antisymmetric component will change its sign. Together they add up to the product. In this section, both types of inner and outer products will be formed and then related to physics. The Grassman Inner and Outer Products There are two basic ways to multiply quaternions together. There is the direct approach. I call this the Grassman product (I do not know if anyone else does, but I need a label). The inner product can also be called the symmetric product, because it does not change signs if the terms are reversed. I have defined the anticommutator (the bold curly braces) in a non-standard way, including a factor of two so I do not have to keep remembering to write it. The first term would be the Lorentz invariant interval if the two quaternions represented the same difference between two events in spacetime (i.e. t=t'=delta t,...). The invariant interval plays a central role in special relativity. The vector terms are a frame-dependent, symmetric product of space with time and does not appear on the stage of physics, but is still a valid measurement. The Grassman outer product is antisymmetric and is formed with a commutator. This is the cross product defined for two 3-vectors. It is unchanged for quaternions. The Euclidean Inner and Outer Products Another important way to multiply a pair of quaternions involves first taking the conjugate of one of the quaternions. For a real-valued matrix representation, this is equivalent to multiplication by the transpose which involves flipping the sign of the 3-vector. Form the Euclidean inner product. The first term is the Euclidean norm if the two quaternions are the same (this was the reason for using the adjective \"Euclidean\"). The Euclidean inner product is also the standard definition of a dot product. Form the Euclidean outer product. The first term is zero. The vector terms are an antisymmetric product of space with time and the negative of the cross product. Implications When multiplying vectors in physics, one normally only considers the Euclidean inner product, or dot product, and the Grassman outer product, or cross product. Yet, the Grassman inner product, because it naturally generates the invariant interval, appears to play a role in special relativity. What is interesting to speculate about is the role of the Euclidean outer product. It is possible that the antisymmetric, vector nature of the space/time product could be related to spin. Whatever the interpretation, the Grassman and Euclidean inner and outer products seem destined to do useful work in physics. Scalars, Vectors, Tensors and All That According to my math dictionary, a tensor is ... An abstract object having a definitely specified system of components in every coordinate system under consideration and such that, under transformation of coordinates, the components of the object undergoes a transformation of a certain nature. To make this introduction less abstract, I will confine the discussion to the simplest tensors under rotational transformations. A rank-0 tensor is known as a scalar. It does not change at all under a rotation. It contains exactly one number, never more or less. There is a zero index for a scalar. A rank-1 tensor is a vector. A vector does change under rotation. Vectors have one index which can run from 1 to the number of dimensions of the field, so there is no way to know a priori how many numbers (or operators, or ...) are in a vector. n-rank tensors have n indices. The number of numbers needed is the number of dimensions in the vector space raised by the rank. Symmetry can often simplify the number of numbers actually needed to describe a tensor. There are a variety of important spin-offs of a standard vector. Dual vectors, when multiplied by its corresponding vector, generate a real number, by systematically multiplying each component from the dual vector and the vector together and summing the total. If the space a vector lives in is shrunk, a contravariant vector shrinks, but a covariant vector gets larger. A tangent vector is, well, tangent to a vector function. Physics equations involve tensors of the same rank. There are scalar equations, polar vector equations, axial vector equations, and equations for higher rank tensors. Since the same rank tensors are on both sides, the identity is preserved under a rotational transformation. One could decide to arbitrarily combine tensor equations of different rank, and they would still be valid under the transformation. There are ways to switch ranks. If there are two vectors and one wants a result that is a scalar, that requires the intervention of a metric to broker the transaction. This process in known as an inner tensor product or a contraction. The vectors in question must have the same number of dimensions. The metric defines how to form a scalar as the indices are examined one-by- one. Metrics in math can be anything, but nature imposes constraints on which ones are important in physics. An aside: mathematicians require that the distance is non-negative, but physicists do not. I will be using the physics notion of a metric. In looking at events in spacetime (a 4-dimensional vector), the axioms of special relativity require the Minkowski metric, which is a 4x4 real matrix that has (1, -1, -1, -1) down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Some people prefer the signs to be flipped, but to be consistent with everything else on this site, I choose this convention. Another popular choice is the Euclidean metric, which is the same as an identity matrix. The result of general relativity for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass is the Schwarzschild metric, which has \"non-one\" terms down the diagonal, zeros elsewhere, and becomes the Minkowski metric in the limit of the mass going to zero or the radius going to infinity. An outer tensor product is a way to increase the rank of tensors. The tensor product of two vectors will be a 2-rank tensor. A vector can be viewed as the tensor product of a set of basis vectors. What Are Quaternions? Quaternions could be viewed as the outer tensor product of a scalar and a 3-vector. Under rotation for an event in spacetime represented by a quaternion, time is unchanged, but the 3-vector for space would be rotated. The treatment of scalars is the same as above, but the notion of vectors is far more restrictive, as restrictive as the notion of scalars. Quaternions can only handle 3-vectors. To those familiar to playing with higher dimensions, this may appear too restrictive to be of interest. Yet physics on both the quantum and cosmological scales is confined to 3-spatial dimensions. Note that the infinite Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics a function of the principle quantum number n, not the spatial dimensions. An infinite collection of quaternions of the form (En, Pn) could represent a quantum state. The Hilbert space is formed using the Euclidean product (q* q'). A dual quaternion is formed by taking the conjugate, because q* q = (t^2 + X.X, 0). A tangent quaternion is created by having an operator act on a quaternion-valued function What would happen to these five terms if space were shrunk? The 3-vector F would get shrunk, as would the divisors in the Del operator, making functions acted on by Del get larger. The scalar terms are completely unaffected by shrinking space, because df/dt has nothing to shrink, and the Del and F cancel each other. The time derivative of the 3-vector is a contravariant vector, because F would get smaller. The gradient of the scalar field is a covariant vector, because of the work of the Del operator in the divisor makes it larger. The curl at first glance might appear as a draw, but it is a covariant vector capacity because of the right-angle nature of the cross product. Note that if time where to shrink exactly as much as space, nothing in the tangent quaternion would change. A quaternion equation must generate the same collection of tensors on both sides. Consider the product of two events, q and q': Where is the axial vector for the left hand side? It is imbedded in the multiplication operation, honest :-) The axial vector is the one that flips signs if the order is reversed. Terms can continue to get more complicated. In a quaternion triple product, there will be terms of the form (XxX').X\". This is called a pseudo-scalar, because it does not change under a rotation, but it will change signs under a reflection, due to the cross product. You can convince yourself of this by noting that the cross product involves the sine of an angle and the dot product involves the cosine of an angle. Neither of these will change under a rotation, and an even function times an odd function is odd. If the order of quaternion triple product is changed, this scalar will change signs for at each step in the permutation. It has been my experience that any tensor in physics can be expressed using quaternions. Sometimes it takes a bit of effort, but it can be done. Individual parts can be isolated if one chooses. Combinations of conjugation operators which flip the sign of a vector, and symmetric and antisymmetric products can isolate any particular term. Here are all the terms of the example from above The metric for quaternions is imbedded in Hamilton's rule for the field. This looks like a way to generate scalars from vectors, but it is more than that. It also says implicitly that i j = k, j k = i, and i, j, k must have inverses. This is an important observation, because it means that inner and outer tensor products can occur in the same operation. When two quaternions are multiplied together, a new scalar (inner tensor product) and vector (outer tensor product) are formed. How can the metric be generalized for arbitrary transformations? The traditional approach would involve playing with Hamilton's rules for the field. I think that would be a mistake, since that rule involves the fundamental definition of a quaternion. Change the rule of what a quaternion is in one context and it will not be possible to compare it to a quaternion in another context. Instead, consider an arbitrary transformation T which takes q into q' T is also a quaternion, in fact it is equal to q' q^-1. This is guaranteed to work locally, within neighborhoods of q and q'. There is no promise that it will work globally, that one T will work for any q. Under certain circumstances, T will work for any q. The important thing to know is that a transformation T necessarily exists because quaternions are a field. The two most important theories in physics, general relativity and the standard model, involve local transformations (but the technical definition of local transformation is different than the idea presented here because it involves groups). This quaternion definition of a transformation creates an interesting relationship between the Minkowski and Euclidean metrics. In order to change from wrist watch time (the interval in spacetime) to the norm of a Hilbert space does not require any change in the transformation quaternion, only a change in the multiplication step. Therefore a transformation which generates the Schwarzschild interval of general relativity should be easily portable to a Hilbert space, and that might be the start of a quantum theory of gravity. So What Is the Difference? I think it is subtle but significant. It goes back to something I learned in a graduate level class on the foundations of calculus. To make calculus rigorous requires that it is defined over a mathematical field. Physicists do this be saying that the scalars, vectors and tensors they work with are defined over the field of real or complex numbers. What are the numbers used by nature? There are events, which consist of the scalar time and the 3-vector of space. There is mass, which is defined by the scalar energy and the 3-vector of momentum. There is the electromagnetic potential, which has a scalar field phi and a 3-vector potential A. To do calculus with only information contained in events requires that a scalar and a 3-vector form a field. According to a theorem by Frobenius on finite dimensional fields, the only fields that fit are isomorphic to the quaternions (isomorphic is a sophisticated notion of equality, whose subtleties are appreciated only by people with a deep understanding of mathematics). To do calculus with a mass or an electromagnetic potential has an identical requirement and an identical solution. This is the logical foundation for doing physics with quaternions. Can physics be done without quaternions? Of course it can! Events can be defined over the field of real numbers, and then the Minkowski metric and the Lorentz group can be deployed to get every result ever confirmed by experiment. Quantum mechanics can be defined using a Hilbert space defined over the field of complex numbers and return with every result measured to date. Doing physics with quaternions is unnecessary, unless physics runs into a compatibility issue. Constraining general relativity and quantum mechanics to work within the same topological algebraic field may be the way to unite these two separately successful areas. Quaternion Analysis Complex numbers are a subfield of quaternions. My hypothesis is that complex analysis should be self-evident within the structure of quaternion analysis. The challenge is to define the derivative in a non-singular way, so that a left derivative always equals a right derivative. If quaternions would only commute... Well, the scalar part of a quaternion does commute. If, in the limit, the differential element converged to a scalar, then it would commute. This idea can be defined precisely. All that is required is that the magnitude of the vector goes to zero faster than the scalar. This might initially appears as an unreasonable constraint. However, there is an important application in physics. Consider a set of quaternions that represent events in spacetime. If the magnitude of the 3-space vector is less than the time scalar, events are separated by a timelike interval. It requires a speed less than the speed of light to connect the events. This is true no matter what coordinate system is chosen. Defining a Quaternion A quaternion has 4 degrees of freedom, so it needs 4 real-valued variables to be defined: Imagine we want to do a simple binary operation such as subtraction, without having to specify the coordinate system chosen. Subtraction will only work if the coordinate systems are the same, whether it is Cartesian, spherical or otherwise. Let e0, e1, e2, and e3 be the shared, but unspecified, basis. Now we can define the difference between two quaternion q and q' that is independent of the coordinate system used for the measurement. What is unusual about this definition are the factors of a third. They will be necessary later in order to define a holonomic equation later in this section. Hamilton gave each element parity with the others, a very reasonable approach. I have found that it is important to give the scalar and the sum of the 3-vector parity. Without this \"scale\" factor on the 3-vector, change in the scalar is not given its proper weight. If dq is squared, the scalar part of the resulting quaternion forms a metric. What should the connection be between the squares of the basis vectors? The amount of intrinsic curvature should be equal, so that a transformation between two basis 3-vectors does not contain a hidden bump. Should time be treated exactly like space? The Schwarzschild metric of general relativity suggests otherwise. Let e1, e2, and e3 form an independent, dimensionless, orthogonal basis for the 3-vector such that: This unusual relationship between the basis vectors is consistent with Hamilton's choice of 1, i, j, k if e0 2 = 1. For that case, calculate the square of dq: The scalar part is known in physics as the Minkowski interval between two events in flat spacetime. If e0 2 does not equal one, then the metric would apply to a non-flat spacetime. A metric that has been measured experimentally is the Schwarzchild metric of general relativity. Set e0 2 = (1 - 2 GM/c 2 R), and calculate the square of dq: This is the Schwarzchild metric of general relativity. Notice that the 3-vector is unchanged (this may be a defining characteristic). There are very few opportunities for freedom in basic mathematical definitions. I have chosen this unusual relationships between the squares of the basis vectors to make a result from physics easy to express. Physics guides my choices in mathematical definitions :-) An Automorphic Basis for Quaternion Analysis A quaternion has 4 degrees of freedom. To completely specify a quaternion function, it must also have four degrees of freedom. Three other linearly- independent variables involving q can be defined using conjugates combined with rotations: The conjugate as it is usually defined (q * ) flips the sign of all but the scalar. The q *1 flips the signs of all but the e1 term, and q *2 all but the e2 term. The set q, q * , q *1 , q *2 form the basis for quaternion analysis. The conjugate of a conjugate should give back the original quaternion. Something subtle but perhaps directly related to spin happens looking at how the conjugates effect products: The conjugate applied to a product brings the result directly back to the reverse order of the elements. The first and second conjugates point things in exactly the opposite way. The property of going \"half way around\" is reminiscent of spin. A tighter link will need to be examined. Future Timelike Derivative Instead of the standard approach to quaternion analysis which focuses on left versus right derivatives, I concentrate on the ratio of scalars to 3-vectors. This is natural when thinking about the structure of Minkowski spacetime, where the ratio of the change in time to the change in 3-space defines five separate regions: timelike past, timelike future, lightlike past, lightlike future, and spacelike. There are no continuous Lorentz transformations to link these regions. Each region will require a separate definition of the derivative, and they will each have distinct properties. I will start with the simplest case, and look at a series of examples in detail. Definition: The future timelike derivative: Consider a covariant quaternion function f with a domain of H and a range of H. A future timelike derivative to be defined, the 3-vector must approach zero faster than the positive scalar. If this is not the case, then this definition cannot be used. Implementing these requirements involves two limit processes applied sequentially to a differential quaternion D. First the limit of the three vector is taken as it goes to zero, (D - D * )/2 -> 0. Second, the limit of the scalar is taken, (D + D * )/2 -> +0 (the plus zero indicates that it must be approached with a time greater than zero, in other words, from the future). The net effect of these two limit processes is that D->0. The definition is invariant under a passive transformation of the basis. The 4 real variables a0, a1, a2, a3 can be represented by functions using the conjugates as a basis. Begin with a simple example: The definition gives the expected result. A simple approach to a trickier example: So far, the fancy double limit process has been irrelevant for these identity functions, because the differential element has been eliminated. That changes with the following example, a tricky approach to the same result. Because the 3-vector goes to zero faster than the scalar for the differential element, after the first limit process, the remaining differential is a scalar so it commutes with any quaternion. This is what is required to dance around the e1 and lead to the cancellation. The initial hypothesis was that complex analysis should be a self-evident subset of quaternion analysis. So this quaternion derivative should match up with the complex case, which is: These are the same result up to two subedits. Quaternions have three imaginary axes, which creates the factor of three. The conjugate of a complex number is really doing the work of the first quaternion conjugate q *1 (which equals -z * ), because z * flips the sign of the first 3-vector component, but no others. The derivative of a quaternion applies equally well to polynomials. This is the expected result for this polynomial. It would be straightforward to show that all polynomials gave the expected results. Mathematicians might be concerned by this result, because if the 3-vector D goes to -D nothing will change about the quaternion derivative. This is actually consistent with principles of special relativity. For timelike separated events, right and left depend on the inertial reference frame, so a timelike derivative should not depend on the direction of the 3-vector. Analytic Functions There are 4 types of quaternion derivatives and 4 component functions. The following table describes the 16 derivatives for this set This table will be used extensively to evaluate if a function is analytic using the chain rule. Let's see if the identity function w = q is analytic. Use the chain rule to calculate the derivative will respect to each term: Use combinations of these terms to calculate the four quaternion derivatives using the chain rule. This has the derivatives expected if w=q is analytic in q. Another test involves the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The presence of the three basis vectors changes things slightly. This also solves a holonomic equation. There are no off diagonal terms to compare. This exercise can be repeated for the other identity functions. One noticeable change is that the role that the conjugate must play. Consider the identity function w = q *1 . To show that this is analytic in q *1 requires that one always works with basis vectors of the q *1 variety. This also solves a first conjugate holonomic equation. Power functions can be analyzed in exactly the same way: This time there are cross terms involved. At first glance, one might think these are incorrect, since the signs of the derivatives are suppose to be opposite. Actually they are, but it is hidden in an accounting trick :-) For example, the derivative of u with respect to a1 has a factor of e1 2 , which makes it negative. The derivative of the first component of V with respect to a0 is positive. Keeping all the information about signs in the e's makes things look non-standard, but they are not. Note that these are three scalar equalities. The other Cauchy-Riemann equations evaluate to a single 3-vector equation. This represents four constraints on the four degrees of freedom found in quaternions to find out if a function happens to be analytic. This also solves a holonomic equation. Since power series can be analytic, this should open the door to all forms of analysis. (I have done the case for the cube of q, and it too is analytic in q). 4 Other Derivatives So far, this work has only involved future timelike derivatives. There are five other regions of spacetime to cover. The simplest next case is for past timelike derivatives. The only change is in the limit, where the scalar approaches zero from below. This will make many derivatives look time symmetric, which is the case for most laws of physics. A more complicated case involves spacelike derivatives. In the spacelike region, changes in time go to zero faster than the absolute value of the 3-vector. Therefore the order of the limit processes is reversed. This time the scalar approaches zero, then the 3-vector. This creates a problem, because after the first limit process, the differential element is (0, D), which will not commute with most quaternions. That will lead to the differential element not cancelling. The way around this is to take its norm, which is a scalar. A spacelike differential element is defined by taking the ratio of a differential quaternion element D to its 3-vector, D - D * . Let the norm of D approach zero. To be defined, the three vector must approach zero faster than its corresponding scalar. To make the definition non-singular everywhere, multiply by the conjugate. In the limit D D * /((D - D * )(D - D * ))* approaches (1, 0), a scalar. To make this concrete, consider a simple example, f = q^2. Apply the definition: The second and fifth terms are unitary rotations of the 3-vector B. Since the differential element D could be pointed anywhere, this is an arbitrary rotation. Define: Substitute, and continue: Look at how wonderfully strange this is! The arbitrary rotation of the 3-vector B means that this derivative is bound by an inequality. If D is in direction of B, then it will be an equality, but D could also be in the opposite direction, leading to a destruction of a contribution from the 3-vector. The spacelike derivative can therefore interfere with itself. This is quite a natural thing to do in quantum mechanics. The spacelike derivative is positive definite, and could be used to define a Banach space. Defining the lightlike derivative, where the change in time is equal to the change in space, will require more study. It may turn out that this derivative is singular everywhere, but it will require some skill to find a technically viable compromise between the spacelike and timelike derivative to synthesis the lightlike derivative. Topological Properties of Quaternions I have not taken a topology class, so no doubt this particular section contains errors. Mathematician are so much more precise than I will ever be. Topological Space If we choose to work systematically through Wald's \"General Relativity\", the starting point is \"Appendix A, Topological Spaces\". Roughly, topology is the structure of relationships that do not change if a space is distorted. Some of the results of topology are required to make calculus rigorous. In this section, I will work consistently with the set of quaternions, H^1, or just H for short. The difference between the real numbers R and H is that H is not a totally ordered set and multiplication is not commutative. These differences are not important for basic topological properties, so statements and proofs involving H are often identical to those for R. First an open ball of quaternions needs to be defined to set the stage for an open set. Define an open ball in H of radius (r, 0) centered around a point (y, Y) [note: small letters are scalars, capital letters are 3-vectors] consisting of points (x, X) such that An open set in H is any set which can be expressed as a union of open balls. [p. 423 translated] A quaternion topological space (H,T) consists of the set H together with a collection T of subsets of H with these properties: The union of an arbitrary collection of subsets, each in T, is in T The intersection of a finite number of subsets of T is in T The entire set H and the empty set are in T T is the topology on H. The subsets of H in T are open sets. Quaternions form a topology because they are what mathematicians call a metric space, since q * q evaluates to a real positive number or equals zero only if q is zero. Note: this is not the meaning of metric used by physicists. For example, the Minkowski metric can be negative or zero even if a point is not zero. To keep the same word with two meanings distinct, I will refer to one as the topological metric, the other as an interval metric. These descriptive labels are not used in general since context usually determines which one is in play. An important component to standard approaches to general relativity is product spaces. This is how a topology for R n is created. Events in spacetime require R 4 , one place for time, three for space. Mathematicians get to make choices: what would change if work was done in R 2 , R 3 , or R 5 ? The precision of this notion, together with the freedom to make choices, makes exploring these decisions fun (for those few who can understand what is going on :-) By working with H, product spaces are unnecessary. Events in spacetime can be members of an open set in H. Time is the scalar, space the 3-vector. There is no choice to be made. Open Sets The edges of sets will be examined by defining boundaries, open and closed sets, and the interior and closure of a set. I am a practical guy who likes pragmatic definitions. Let the real numbers L and U represent arbitrary lower and upper bounds respectively such that L < U. For the quaternion topological space (H, T), consider an arbitrary induced topology (A, t) where x and a are elements of A. Use inequalities to define: The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open. The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open. The union of a finite number of closed sets is closed. The intersection of an arbitrary number of closed sets is closed. Clearly there are connections between the above definitions This creates complementary ideas. [Wald, p.424] The interior of A is the union of all open sets contained within A. The interior equals A if and only if A is open. The closure of A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. The closure of A equals A if and only if A is closed. Define a point set as the set where the lower bound equals the upper bound. The only open set that is a point set is the null set. The closed point set is H. A point set for the real numbers has only one element which is identical to the boundary. A point set for quaternions has an infinite number of elements, one of them identical to the boundary. What are the implications for physics? With quaternions, the existence an open set of events has nothing to do with the causality of that collection of events. A proper time can have exactly the same absolute value as a pure spacelike separation, so these two will be included in the same sets, whether open, closed or on a boundary. There is no correlation the reverse way either. Take for example a collection of lightlike events. Even though they all share exactly the same interval - namely zero - their absolute value can vary all over the map, not staying within limits. Although independent, these two ideas can be combined synergistically. Consider an open set S of timelike intervals. The set S could depict a classical world history since they are causally linked and have good topological properties. A closed set of lightlike events could be a focus of quantum electrodynamics. Topology plus causality could be the key for subdividing different regions of physics. Hausdorff Topology This property is used to analyze compactness, something vital for rigorously establishing differentiation and integration. [Wald p424] The quaternion topological space (H, T) is Hausdorff because for each pair of distinct points a, b E H, a not equal to b, one can find open sets Oa, Ob E T such that a E Oa, b I Ob and the intersection of Oa and Ob is the null set. For example, find the half-way point between a and b. Let that be the radius of an open ball around the points a and b: Neither set quite reaches the other, so their intersection is null. Compact Sets In this section, I will begin an investigation of compact sets of quaternions. I hope to share some of my insights into this subtle but significant topic. First we need the definition of a compact set of quaternions. [Translation of Wald p. 424] Let A be a subset of the quaternions H. Set A could be opened, closed or neither. An open cover of A is the union of open sets {Oa} that contains A. A union of open sets is open and could have an infinite number of members. A subset of {Oa} that still covers A is called a subcover. If the subcover has a finite number of elements it is called a finite subcover. The set A subset of H is compact if every open cover of A has a finite subcover. Let's find an example of a compact set of quaternions. Consider a set S composed of points with a finite number of absolute values: The set S has an infinite number of members, since for any of the equalities, specifying the absolute value still leaves three degrees of freedom (if the domain had been x E R, then S would have had a finite number of elements). The set S can be covered by an open set {O} which could have an infinite number of members. There exists a subset {C} of {O} that is finite and still covers S. The subset {C} would have one member for each absolute value. Every set of quaternions composed of a finite number of absolute values like the set S is compact. Notice that the set S is closed because it consists of a boundary without an interior. The link between compact, closed and bound set is important, and will be examined next A compact set is a statement about the ability to find a finite number of open sets that cover a set, given any open cover. A closed set is the interior of a set plus the boundary of that set. A set is bound if there exists a real number M such that the distance between a point and any member of the set is less than M. For quaternions with the standard topology, in order to have a finite number of open sets that cover the set, the set must necessarily include its boundary and be bound. In other words, to be compact is to be closed and bound, to be closed and bound is to be compact. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 1 (Heine-Borel). A closed interval of quaternions S: with the standard topology on H is compact. Wald does not provide a proof since it appears in many books on analysis. Invariably the Heine-Borel Theorem employs the domain of the real numbers, x E R. However, nothing in that proof changes by using quaternions as the domain. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 2. Let the topology (H, T) be Hausdorff and let the set A subset of H be compact. Then A is closed. Theorem 3. Let the topology (H, T) be compact and let the set A subset of H be closed. Then A is compact. Combine these theorems to create a stronger statement on the compactness of subsets of quaternions H. Theorem 4. A subset A of quaternions is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The property of compactness is easily proved to be preserved under continuous maps. Theorem 5. Let (H, T) and (H', T') be topological spaces. Suppose (H, T) is compact and the function f: H -> H' is continuous. The f[H] = {h' E H' | h' = f(h)} is compact. This creates a corollary by theorem 4. Theorem 6. A continuous function from a compact topological space into H is bound and its absolute value attains a maximum and minimum values. [end translation of Wald] R 1 versus R n It is important to note that these theorems for quaternions are build directly on top of theorems for real numbers, R 1 . Only the domain needs to be changed to H 1 . Wald continues with theorems on product spaces, specifically Tychonoff's Theorem, so that the above theorems can be extended to R n . In particular, the product space R 4 should have the same topology as the quaternions. Hopefully, subtlety matters in the discussion of the logical foundations of general relativity. Both R 1 and H 1 have a rule for multiplication, but H 1 has an antisymmetric component. This is a description of a difference. R 4 does not come equipped with a rule for multiplication, so it is qualitatively different, even if topologically similar to the quaternions. Where do quaternions fit in with math? Adapted from a figure by Max Tegmark, 1998. A Quaternion Algebra Tool Set Here is a compilation of basic algebra for quaternions. It should look very similar to complex algebra, since it contains three sets of complex numbers, t + x i, t + y j, and t + z k. To strengthen the link, and keep things looking simpler, all quaternions have been written as a pair of a scalar t and a 3-vector V, as in (t, V). All these relations have been tested in a C library and a Java quaternion calculator. Technical note: it is vital that every tool in this set can be expressed as working with a whole quaternion q. This will make doing quaternion analysis with automorphic functions fruitful. Parts Simple algebra Multiplication The Grassman product as defined here uses the same rule Hamilton developed. The Euclidean product takes the conjugate of the first of the two elements (following a tradition from quantum mechanics). Trigonometry Note: since the unit vectors of sine and cosine are the same, these two commute so the order is irrelevant. Powers Logs Quaternion exponential multiplication Andrew Millard suggested the result for the Grassman product. Newton's Second Law The form of Newton's second law for three separate cases will be generated using quaternion operators acting on position quaternions. In classical mechanics, time and space are decoupled. One way that can be achieved algebraically is by having a time operator cat only on space, or by space operator only act on a scalar function. I call this the \"2 zero\" rule: if there are two zeros in the generator of a law in physics, the law is classical. Newton's 2nd Law for an Inertial Reference Frame in Cartesian Coordinates Define a position quaternion as a function of time. Operate on this once with the differential operator to get the velocity quaternion. Operate on the velocity to get the classical inertial acceleration quaternion. This is the standard form for acceleration in Newton's second law in an inertial reference frame. Because the reference frame is inertial, the first term is zero. Newton's 2nd Law in Polar Coordinates for a Central Force in a Plane Repeat this process, but this time start with polar coordinates. The velocity in a plane. Acceleration in a plane. Not a pretty sight. For a central force, = = 0. Make these substitution and rotate the quaternion to get rid of the theta dependence. The second term is the acceleration in the radial direction, the third is acceleration in the theta direction for a central force in polar coordinates. Newton's 2nd Law in a Noninertial, Rotating Frame Consider the \"noninertial\" case, with the frame rotating at an angular speed omega. The differential time operator is put into the first term of the quaternion, and the three directions for the angular speed are put in the next terms. This quaternion is then multiplied by the position quaternion to get the velocity in a rotating reference frame. Unlike the previous examples where t did not interfere with the calculations, this time it must be set explicitly to zero (I wonder what that means?). Operate on the velocity quaternion with the same operator. The first three terms of the 3-vector are the translational, coriolis, and azimuthal alterations respectively. The last term of the 3-vector may not look like the centrifugal force, but using a vector identity it can be rewritten: If the angular velocity an the radius are orthogonal, then The scalar term is not zero. What this implies is not yet clear, but it may be related to the fact that the frame is not inertial. Implications Three forms of Newton's second law were generated by choosing appropriate operator quaternions acting on position quaternions. The differential time operator was decoupled from any differential space operators. This may be viewed as an operational definition of \"classical\" physics. Oscillators and Waves A professor of mine once said that everything in physics is a simple harmonic oscillator. Therefore it is necessary to get a handle on everything. The Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) The differential equation for a simple harmonic oscillator in one dimension can be express with quaternion operators. This equation can be solved directly. Find the velocity by taking the derivative with respect to time. The Damped Simple Harmonic Oscillator Generate the differential equation for a damped simple harmonic oscillator as done above. Solve the equation. The Wave Equation Consider a wave traveling along the x direction. The equation which governs its motion is given by The third term is the one dimensional wave equation. The forth term is the instantaneous power transmitted by the wave. Implications Using the appropriate combinations of quaternion operators, the classical simple harmonic oscillator and wave equation were written out and solved. The functional definition of classical physics employed here is that the time operator is decoupled from any space operator. There is no reason why a similar combination of operators cannot be used when time and space operators are not decoupled. In fact, the four Maxwell equations appear to be one nonhomogeneous quaternion wave equation, and the structure of the simple harmonic oscillator appears in the Klein-Gordon equation. Four Tests for a Conservative Force There are four well-known, equivalent tests to determine if a force is conservative: the curl is zero, a potential function whose gradient is the force exists, all closed path integrals are zero, and the path integral between any two points is the same no matter what the path chosen. In this notebook, quaternion operators perform these tests on quaternion-valued forces. 1. The Curl Is Zero To make the discussion concrete, define a force quaternion F. The curl is the commutator of the differential operator and the force. If this is zero, the force is conservative. Let the differential operator quaternion act on the force, and test if the vector components equal zero. 2. There Exists a Potential Function for the Force Operate on force quaternion using integration. Take the negative of the gradient of the first component. If the field quaternion is the same, the force is conservative. This is the same force as we started with, so the scalar inside the integral is the scalar potential of this vector field. The vector terms inside the integral arise as constants of integration. They are zero if t=z=0. What role these vector terms in the potential quaternion may play, if any, is unknown to me. 3. The Line Integral of Any Closed Loop Is Zero Use any parameterization in the line integral, making sure it comes back to go. 4. The Line Integral Along Different Paths Is the Same Choose any two parameterizations from A to B, and test that they are the same. These paths are from (0, r, 0, 0) to (0, -r, 2 r, 0). The same! Implications The four standard tests for a conservative force can be done with operator quaternions. One new avenue opened up is for doing path integrals. It would be interesting to attempt four dimensional path integrals to see where that might lead! Problem set answers for MITs 8.033 using real valued quaternions Problem set 1 Problem sets 2-6 are at another site, Doing Special Relativity with Quaternions The Back Story In early 1997, I had a meeting with a famous physicist to discuss my research project. Actually, I sat outside his door and talked with him to and from the chinese food truck. He thought my project was \"Interesting, but not very interesting.\" The reason was that I had a few math widgets, but no theory. I thanked him for his time. Now I had to find a theory. This is a crazy assignment. I decided to begin my search by posing a question: define a brief definition of time that must be two sentences or less and only be about phyiscs or math, not philosophy. My runon sentence answer used quaternions as a definition of events in space-time. To test the hypothesis, I asked the professor who taught the class if I could audit 8.033, Classical and Relativitic Mechanics (it is now online ). He approved. As a test of quaternions as an essential tool for physics, I had three ground rules for the assigned problems: Each problem had to be solved the standard way Each problem had to be solved using real-valued quaternions If any problem could not be solved with real-valued quaternions, there would be no need to look further into quaternions It turned out that all 53 assigned problems were solved using real-valued quaternions. That was the start of my ongoing study. To avoid the book being overrun with the problem set answers, they were moved to a separate book. 8.033 Problem Set 1, Kinematic Effects of Relativity Preamble: Initiation functions There are a few tools required to solve problems in special relativity using quaternions to characterize events in spacetime. The most basic are gamma and a round value for c. Define a function for quaternions using its matrix representation. A quaternion L that perform a transform on a quaternion - L q[ x ] = q[ x' ] - identical to how the Lorentz transformation acts on 4-vectors - Lambda x = x' - should exist. These are described in detail in the notebook \"A different algebra for boosts.\" For boosts along the x axis with y = z = 0, the general function for L is Most of the problems here involve much simpler cases for L, where t or x is zero, or t is equal to x. If t = 0, then If x = 0, then If t = x, then Note: this is for blueshifts. Redshifts have a plus instead of the minus. The problems are from \"Basic Concepts in Relativity\" by Resnick and Halliday, 1992 by Macmillian Publishing, \"Special Relativity\" by A. P. French, 1966, 1968 by MIT, and Prof. M. Baranger of MIT. R&H 2-9: A moving clock Q: A clock moves along the x axis at a speed of 0.6c and reads zero as it passes the origin. What time does it read as it passes the 180 m mark on the x axis? A: A clock measures an interval between two events. The first event occurs at the origin. The second event happens at 180 m in a time of 180 m/v. Calculate the interval by squaring the difference quaternion and then taking the square root of the first term. The moving clock reads 8 x 10 -7 seconds. R&H 2-10: A moving rocket Q: A rod lies parallel to the x axis of reference frame S, moving along this axis at a speed of 0.6c. Its rest length is 1.0 m. What will be its measured length in frame S? A: Consider the meter stick at rest in a frame S', one end at the origin, the other at q[0, 1 m, 0, 0]. We want to boost the stick end quaternion to frame S. The boost quaternion when t=y=z=0 is . In frame S',frame S is moving at -0.6c. The start of the stick will move for a time equal to the first term of the boosted quaternion, and moved by a distance x = vt/c. The meter stick's length in frame S will be the difference at the same instant in this frame between the boosted stick end and translocated stick start. The meter stick is length contracted to 0.8 meters in frame S. R&H 2-13: A fast spaceship Q: The length of a spaceship is measured to be exactly half its rest length. (a) What is the speed of the spaceship relative to the observer's frame? (b) By what factor does the spaceship's clocks run slow, compared to clocks in the observer's frame? A: (a) Consider the spaceship at rest, one end at the origin, the other at q[0, d, 0, 0]. We want to boost the ship end quaternion to the observer's frame. The boost quaternion when t=y=z=0 is . In the ship'sframe, the observer is moving at -v/c. The start of the ship will move for a time equal to the first term of the boosted quaternion, and moved by a distance x = vt/c. The ship's length in the observer's frame will be the difference at the same instant in this frame between the boosted ship end and translocated ship start. Solve for beta setting this distance to d/2. Beta is /2 = 0.866. (b) The factor that the clocks appear to run at different rates is gamma. Measure the difference between space-time events Two stars go supernova while four kids watch. There is a difference in time (dt). There is a difference in space (dR). Together they make a difference in space-time. Each kid measures a different values for time and space. Yet the walkers agree on something they can calculate called the interval. This is the standard physics of Special Relativity, the physics of moving. This site promotes a new proposal for gravity called Quaternion Gravity where the kids above or below agree on a different value they calculate, space-times-time. gIn this standard approach to gravity known as General Relativity, this is almost, but not quite true. For nerds Special relativity is special because it is restricted to inertial observers. g To cover more cases requires the machinery of differential geometry. gA tensor can be added to another tensor or multiplied by a scalar. gAn interval is formed by contracting two rank 1 contra-variant tensors with a symmetric, rank-2 metric tensor. gA connection is needed to describe how the metric changes in space-time. gThere are many technical choices one makes along the way to calculating an interval in curved space-time. The site issues a formal challenge to the algebraic standards of differential geometry used today by physics. In place of tensors, metrics, and connections, only quaternions will be used. gFor those trained in the craft of differential geometry, that should sound wildly inadequate. Doing more with less is always a challenge. Special relativity Walking changes how one measures deadly supernovae. As long as the kids move at a constant rate, special relativity comes into play. Relativity is not an arbitrary change, but increadibly precise change. And there is that interval that is exactly the same size. Note: the numbers are far too big (off by 16 orders of magnitude, I just didn't want to write lots of zeros). For nerds Take measurements made by two observers written as quaternions and square them. If the first terms are the same, then the two observers are in reference frames that are moving in a steady way relative to each other. Note that the observers can be in a gravity field which is a non-inertial reference frame, but that does not cause an issue here. The observers do not have to make sure their coordinate systems are the same. So long as both agree to compare so called natural units (a way to consistently be dimensionless), then the numbers will be the same. Quaternion gravity Looking down or looking from below changes time and space measurements in opposite ways. If one kid is at a different height in a gravity field to another, then time measurements get smaller while spatial ones get bigger. That is standard physics (general relativity, GR). The Quaternion Gravity (QG) proposal says the space-times-time values are precisely the same. With general relativity, this space-times-time is not mentioned, but it is almost - but not quite - the same. Note: the numbers are far too big (off by 16 orders of magnitude, I just didn't want to write lots of zeros). For nerds Special relativity could have been called \"special invariance\" because it is the invariant interval that all inertial observers argee upon. Inviarnce principles are deep insights into how Nature works. They are truths that do not change. The quaternion gravity proposal postulates a new invariance principle: that different observers making measurements in different locations in a gravitational field will agree on an invariant value for space-times-time. Some care is required to say this in a coordinate-independent way. All observers are free to pick their coordinate system. There then exists a norm-preserving rotation in space such that the space-times-time measurement of one observer is exactly equal to another. But how precisely does the interval change? For a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, unchanged source, only one dimensionless ratio comes into play: GM/c 2 R. Orbital systems are harmonic systems, suggesting that one use exponential of the dimensionless ratio. The requirment that the space-times-time term is invariant means the time term is the inverse of the exponential experienced by the space term, like so: The resulting exponential interval has the same form as the Rosen metric. The Rosen matric makes the same experimental predictions as the Schwarzschild metric for all weak field gravity tests to first order Parameterize Post-Newtonian (PPN) accuracy. At second order PPN accuracy, the exponential interval predicts 12% more bending of light around the Sun. We have yet to acheive the precision to decide this issue on experimental data. Special relativity is not a field field theory. It is a constraint on all field theories. The quaternion gravity proposal is also not a field theory. Like special relativity, it is a constraint on all field theories. As such, there is no need for a graviton. Quaternion gravity makes the search for quantum gravity moot. SR + QG - S pecial R elativity and Q uaternion G ravity This graphic says most of it... Start with the reference square which has an interval of 16 and a space-times time of 30. Compare the reference square with the walkers. They all have the same interval of 16 because that in what is invariant for inertial observers, folks moving at a constant speed compared to the reference. Compare the reference square with the girl above and boy below. Because they are in a gravitational field, they are not inertial observers. The quaternion gravity proposal says the space-times-time value are exactly the same at 30. The interval will be of different sizes. If one compares a walker to one of the kids above or below, there is no overlap between them. For nerds Since there is a gravitational field everywhere, there are no inertial observers. Working with the squares of quaternions, things are a little easier. Just compare the reference square with any other square. For the walkers, since they travel at a constant speed and are at the same location in the gravitational field as the reference square, they will have the same interval. The kids above and below are not moving compared to the reference square. By the quaternion gravity proposal, the space-times-time is an invariant. All agree on the value of 30. What then has to be different is the interval. But how different, and how does that depend on the gravitional source mass? Fortunately, there is no choice in answering the question if one is to be consistent with current experimental tests of gravity. For a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged source, gravity depends on the ratio of the graviational source mass over the distance to the center of that mass. Whatever function is used to make the time measurement smaller must be the exact inverse of the one that makes a spatial measurment larger. Since gravitational systems follow simple harmonic patterns for billions of years, an exponential and its inverse that depens on the M/R ratio is an obvious thing to propose. The interval looks just like the Rosen bi-metric proposal, even though quaternion gravity uses no metrics. The Rosen metric is known to be consistent with current tests of weak field gravity up to first-order Parametrized Post-Newtonian accuracy. The extra metric creates a problem for Rosen's proposal since gravity waves would have a dipole moment and lose entry faster than observed. The simplicity of the quaternion gravity proposal would require for an isolated mass in space that the lowest mode of emission is a quadrapole, consistent with what is seen. Yet there is no graviton with quaternion gravity. The energy could be carried away with photons that happen to have a quadrapole moment, but no a dipole one. My entry to the 2015 Awards for Essays on Gravitation is a more formal presentation of this research effort, available as a pdf . Quaternion Space-times-time Invariance as Gravity* D. B. Sweetser March 31, 2015 *Essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2015 Awards for Essays on Gravitation 39 Drummer Road, Acton, MA 01720 sweetser@alum.mit.edu Abstract The square of a quaternion luckily has the Lorentz invariant interval of special relativity as its first term. The other three space-times-time terms are commonly ignored. Ways to vary a quaternion with a continuous function that leave the intraval in the square invariant are discussed. One method uses exponentials, leading to the hyperbolic functions found useful in special relativity. Using the same approach to keep the space-times-time invariantleads to a dynamic interval term. By preserving the space-times-time terms using an exponential function and the geometric source mass, an interval term is found that is similar but experimentally distinct from the Schwarzschild metric applied to space-time 4-vectors. Space-times-time invariance is not a field theory, so gravitons are not necessary and quantization is moot. General relativity, Einstein's elegant theory of gravity, is a field theory like the three other fundamental forces of Nature: electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force. The cause of gravity is any form of energy or momentum. The field equations dictate the motion of particles with energy, thus applying to all particles, even light. Special relativity is not a special case of general relativity, despite the name. Special relativity is about an invariant quantity in Nature that all inertial observers agree upon: the interval, a difference of squares in measurements of space and time. Special relativity applies to all measurements, even those involving the fundamental forces. The product of a measurement in space and one in time, referred to hereafter as space-times- time, will change in known ways for different inertial observers. 1 This essay explores the opposite situation: what if two observers find their space-times-time was an invariant, but their intervals were different? It is suggestive that a defining characteristic of general relativity is that intervals vary at different places in a gravitational field. The invariant interval of special relativity in flat spacetime is generated by contracting a 4-vector using the Minkowski metric. With such a simple system, other products are omitted, namely, any with the space-times-time form, dtdxi. Such terms could appear if one used a metric with non-diagonal components which are unnecessary for flat spacetime. There is a type of math that naturally embraces space-times-time terms. All are familiar with real numbers, a mathematical field that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The complex numbers are also a mathematical field, but now one has two degrees of freedom, often represented by a pair of numbers. 2 Complex numbers are no longer a totally ordered set. The next sort of numbers has four-part harmonies, with a real bass and three imaginary tenors. Known as the quaternions, they do not commute, so live with the label of a division algebra. Quaternions still retain addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The rules are similar for the complex numbers, with the imaginary i replaced by an imaginary 3-vector and the inclusion of the anti-symmetric cross product. Quaternions play a minor technical role as the best way to do rotations in three dimensions.[8] A unit quaternion SU(2) sits in the center of the standard model gauge symmetries. Despite that central role, quaternions have historically been vilified to a comic degree. \"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way, including Maxwell.\" Lord Kelvin[10, See vol. II, p. 1070.] There are published claims that one cannot write the Maxwell equations or represent the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions.[2, 4, 6, 9] Neither happens to be true. See the appendix for details if interested. The square of a space-time measurement represented with quaternions is: The first term of the square is the Lorentz invariant interval. It is followed by the three space-times-time terms. There are a few advantages to having these three extra bits of information. Say two inertial observers Alice and Bob saw a collection of events. The first term of the square of the quaternion would be the same. An analysis of the space-times-time value would let us know how Alice was moving relative to Bob. If they also calculate the product of two different events in both orders, then we would know something about the angle between the events and the observer. If ab = ba, then they are in a straight line. If for the three space-times-time terms, ab = -ba , they are at a right angle. Anything between those extremes is in between. What happens in curved space-time? With the standard machinery of differential geometry, a simple subtraction is not allowed. Instead, one has to parallel transport one event to another along a geodesic using a known connection. Then the subtraction can be done properly. Quaternions don't have a metric. Without a metric, there is no connection. Maybe quaternions are an \"unmixed evil.\" Let's explore anyway. Construct a quaternion out of space-time functions that can be varied, yet the first term of the square is invariant as required by special relativity: If the function f was exactly the same as each normalized gi, then the first term in the square, the interval, would always be zero. 3 This is an important case: it is light. Changes in time are exactly equal to the magnitude of changes in space. With zero covered, find a way so the first term in the square is equal to one for all inertial observers. The square of f must cancel out the square of g, but leave unity behind. Work with a third function h and its inverse: So long as the function h has an inverse, this will always work. 4 Exponential functions play an important role in theoretical physics. If the exponent is zero, unity is the result and nothing is changed. For tiny exponents, the result may contain a simple harmonic oscillator which are ubiquitous in Nature. For the case in hand, the function f is a hyperbolic cosine which is the stretch factor gamma of special relativity. The function g is the hyperbolic sine, the gamma beta factor that also appears in special relativity. Repeat these two simple math exercises for space-times-time. Find a general way to make the square of a measurement have either three zeroes or three ones - times the factor of two that is from the sum of two identical terms. Generating three zero space-times-time factors is easy: take the norm of any quaternion. Some effort has gone into quantum mechanics that uses quaternions in place of complex numbers.[1] That topic is beyond the scope of this short essay. The general way to generate three factors of two is also not difficult: An exponential function could be plugged in as before. This moves from a pure math exercise to one with physics content if the exponential is chosen to be related to gravity by using the geometric length of a mass 5 : Let's pause to discuss this expression. No metric was used to get here. No field equation was solved. Instead a new invariance of Nature has been proposed as it applies to products of quaternions in a weak gravitational system characterized by one length. Algebraically, the first term is the same as the Rosen exponential metric applied to an event 4-vector.[7] Experimental tests of weak gravity fields use the first three terms of the Taylor series expansion in z for the change in time, and the first two for changes in space. Those terms are identical for the space-times-time invariant expression and the Schwarzschild metric in Cartesian coordinates. There is no way to distinguish these two at what is called first-order Parameterized Post- Newtonian (PPN) accuracy. At second order, the new invariance proposal predicts 6% more bending of light around a gravitational source.[3] Since the effect is smaller than a micro-arcsecond, that is beyond our reach today. Massless light is bent by gravity. That can be accounted for in general relativity because the coupling is to energy density which light has. With the space-times-time invariance, there is no coupling term nor any field equations. The same thing happens in special relativity: there is no coupling, nor field equations. The space-times-time invariance may be the correct variation on the invariant interval of special relativity, thus being the simplest pure geometry approach to gravity, but not too simple. With no graviton to quantize, there is no issue of quantizing a gravitational field. What about energy loss by a binary pulsar? The Rosen metric allows for a dipole mode of gravity wave emission, so is ruled out by the data which requires a lower rate of gravity wave emissions.[11, See section 12.3(b).] In the space-times-time invariant proposal, the exponential function and its inverse applied to gravity above was static. Make it dynamic by including a time factor in a way consistent with how we see the metric change in time for a binary pulsar. Is a graviton required to carry away the energy? The system in question is an isolated binary pulsar that conserves both energy and momentum. It does not have a dipole moment like a magnet, but does have a quadruple moment, like a wobbling water balloon. The energy could be carried away by an electromagnetic field that had a quadruple as its lowest moment. While unusual, it is possible. Does gravity as a space-times-time invariance play nicely with the three other fundamental forces of physics? Given the stellar record of special relativity, there is reason to hope. Appendix: Maxwell equations and the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions The homogeneous Maxwell equations are vector identities. They hold when written using quaternions. The Lagrange density used to derive the Maxwell source equations is the difference of the squared magnetic and electric fields[5]: The difference of two squares is the product of their sums and difference. The simplest product of a quaternion differential operator and potential generates the difference of the magnetic and electric fields: This also has a gauge field g which can easily be eliminated by subtracting the conjugate of this product. The sum of these two fields - times a factor of minus one - is formed by reversing the order of the differential with the potential: The first term drops into the Euler-Lagrange equations to generate the Gauss and Ampere laws of electromagnetism. As a bonus, there is the Poynting vector, the directional energy flux density of an electromagnetic field. Representing the compact Lie group needed to do spatial rotations is itself compact when using quaternions: If one tries to simply change from the cosine and sine function to the hyperbolic cosine and sine function, a member of the Lorentz group is not generated. This should not be a surprise since that group is not compact, a non-trivial change. Other terms are required to pull off the trick: Quaternions provide another way to write these expressions. Nothing new is learned, other than to be skeptical of claims about the limitations of quaternions. Bibliography [1] S. L. Adler. Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.

Footnotes Essays on Gravitation contest The essay, \"Quaternion space-times-time invariance as gravity\" was submitted to the 2015 Essays on Gravitation contest run by the Gravity Research Foundation . By comparison with typical technical physics papers, an effort was made to make the math simpler and have less jargon. It is seven pages long. It has five equations in the body of the paper, and five more in the appendix. There are eleven references. The results are in... The winner was an essay by Gerard 't Hooft, a Nobel Prize winner and all around smart guy. My essay did not win second, or third, or forth, or fifth, or honerable mention. The contest gets plenty of submissions from fringe physicists. I suspect the word \"quaternion\" in the title and my non-academic address meant the paper was quickly dismissed. Hard core stuff I did learn something about my own efforts from reading the paper. His paper was about conformal symmetry breaking. Roughly speaking, that has to do with the scale of measurements in time and space. Maxwell's theory for how light works has conformal symmetry. If we use light to measure things, then the absolute size of anything cannot be known. Cool. We can figure out relative sizes and times. This cannot be the entire story since we can figure out the the absolute sizes of things. He writes that something about quantum gravity is going to break conformal symmetry. You would have to read the paper to struggle to see his point. In my own effort, there are two numbers that enter in to make measurements different. One is the relativistic velocity of an observer. That is plain old special relativity. The other is the dimensionless gravitational length of a graviational source. It would be this value that breaks conformal symmetry in quaternion gravity. Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations The Euler-Lagrange equations are used to generate field equations from a Lagrange density. Think of a Lagrange density as every way energy can be traded inside of a box. The action S integrates the Lagrange density (mass per volume) over space and time , resulting in t mass times time. Notice that the action could be just about any value by integrating over different amounts of time, from a nano-second to a billion years. The approach is to vary something in the action S so this integral does not change . This means that the \"something\" is a symmetry of the action. Where there is a symmetry, there is necessarily a conserved quantity. This is a minimization problem, or more formally, the calculus of variations. the first types of minimization problems one learns are about the minimum value of something like a velocity at a point in space-time. this is about a minimization of a function over all of space-time. the mechanics are the same - take a derivative, set it to zero - but the thing that gets plugged in is different. Examples If the lagrange density is not a function of time , then time is a symmetry and energy is conserved. If the lagrange density is not a function of space , then space is a symmetry and linear momentum is conserved. If the lagrange density is not a function of angle , then rotation is a symmetry and angular momentum is conserved. Counter example If a lagrange equation is a function of space and time , then energy and momentum are not conserved . this happens for systems that have friction. the energy and momentum go into waste heat. those terms usually are not included in the lagrange density. Deriving the euler-lagrange equations If a lagrange density depends on a 4-potential a and the derivatives of a, then vary these and find a minimum. this is the heart of the euler-lagrange equations. This is a mimnum problem with the potential A and its derivative, A'. 1: Start with a Lagrange density that is a function of the potential and its derivatives. Note that one is not allowed to vary position or speed. If we were to do the reverse - fix the potential and its derivative, but vary position and velocity - then we would be deriving the force equation from the same Lagrange density. 2: For the action by integrating over a volume of space-time. 3: Vary the action. 4: The problem is with the variation in A versus the variantion is the derivative of A. Use the product rule to get two variations in A. 5: A theorem of Gauss says: so: 6: Subsitute 5 into the variation in 3: 7: The variation will be at the minimum if the variation in the action S is zero, which happends if the integrand is zero: QED There are so many partial differential equations when using Euler-Lagrange, people with thin you are brilliant. EM invariants To derive the field equations of electromagnetism (EM), we need to find Lorentz invariants that use the electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields of EM that then get plugged into the Euler-Lagrange equation. An invariant is something all observers can agree on. The Egyptions fiture out one long ago: This was the basis for surveying in the flood plains of the Nile. It remains true today. The 3D Egyptions know we could also include a third spacial dimension: Einstein showed that Egyptions in rockets could only agree on the inverval between events. Accelerating or spinning is alright for observing events is you can figure out the right sort of functions to put into the interval. Masters of general relativity can figure out the dynamic functions for f and g in only a few special cases because the math remains so difficult. The proposal described in this site, quaternion gravity, should make this issue tractable since then one has an algebra problem instead of ten nonliner differential equations to solve. For the rest of the discussion of EM, it is assumed f and g are equal to one since it makes the math simple. The first term of a quaternion product is a Lorentz invariant scalar. Couple the current with the potential by multiplying them together: The electric and magentic fields can be written in terms of differential operators acting on a potential. Form the product: The first term is a gauge term. EM has gauge symmetry. Set this to zero in a way that assures that no matter what gauge we pick - terms involving the time derivative of phi or divergence of A - the other terms are unchanged. There are two times of 3-vectors. An axial vector will not change if the the order of the product is reverse. A polar vector will flip signs by changing the order. That is a property of cross products and curls. Here are the two possibilities: These should both be as \"long\" as each other, but will point in a different direction so long as the magnetic field B is not zero. Zero is an invariant, so take the difference of the norms of both of these, and that will always, necssarily, be equal to zero. The dot product of the electric and magnetic field will be used to derive the homogenous Maxwell equations, the no monopoles and Faraday's law. The product of the two ways to multiply a differential and a potential also form an invariant: This Lorentz invariant quantity will be used when deriving the Maxwell source equations, Gauss' and Ampere's laws. Derive the Maxwell homogeneous equations The easy way There are several different roads to the same results, the no monopoles law and Faraday's law, known together as the homogenous equations. The quickest path is to show how they are vector idenities. The divergence of a curl is zero, so if the magnetic field is the curl of the potential A, then there are no magnetic monopoles. One down, one to go. Plug the potential definitions of a B and E field into Faraday's law, and watch all the terms drop. QED. The path followed here is considerably longer. Everyone uses the Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the source equations, Gauss' law and Ampere's law. For the sake of logical consistency, and to get practice with the details of Euler-Lagrange, the same machinery will be used to derive all four Maxwell equations. Maxwell defined The Maxwell equations are the pinnacle of classical physics, the way all light, electric charges, and magnets play with each other gracefully. Here is a one sentence definition: The Maxwell equations define how a current density is the source of all the changes in space-time of changes in space-time of a space-time potential that travels at the speed of light. The Maxwell equations are a complete set of second order differential equations along with the vector identities. Nothing is missing. 1 The fields defined A quaternion derivative has a time derivative and three spatial derivatives. A quaternion potential has a scalar potential and three others for space no matter what one's choice of coordinate systems. Construct the complete set of first order changes of a potential by taking the product. Simple enough. No, stop. This is amazing enough to repeat. The most basic complete quaternion derivative of a potential is EM But what about that first term? One of the defining characteristic of light is how its interval is zero. A photon cannot wear a watch. Photons are timeless. The way to implement that quality is to set this gauge term equal to zero like so: This is a recurring technique. If something travels at the speed of light, there will be non of the the four gauge terms: The electric and magnetic field are unchanged by changing the guage because the gauge terms are always subtracted away. One enormous subject I have not looked into is what happens if one keeps this gauge term. The resulting physics must describe thing that do not travel at the speed of light. It is the subject of particles with a mass. The plan Here is how we will derive the no monopoles law. Start with 1 easy term, E x Pair that with 1 B x Multiply it out Clone lines, filling in E y and E z Look for patterns Writing out the Lagrangian The dot product of the electric and magnetic fields has 24 terms. It is scary, so start simple with one term only, E x : The magnetic field B x has everything not found in E x , including both the potentials and derivatives. It is seeing details like all four potential terms and all four differentials in each line that makes the Maxwell equations feel so complete. Multiply this out. Half the terms are positive, half are negative, setting up for cancellations. Each term has a t, x, y, z-ish part. 8 down, 16 to go. Clone E x to make E y and E z making all necessary subsitutions: Look for patterns in the partial derivatives: The electric field terms are in yellow. The top line has the magnetic field, B x . None of these has an x , it is pairs of y 's and z 's. The next part of the puzzle is to figure out where the rest of the derivative with respect to x go. That will dictate where the other partials go too. This is the game of curl Sudoku. Fill in the missing values for x , y and z . All the needed slots are filled in. The Soduko game is complete. Now remove some of the details. The dot product of E and B is pretty: The Lorentz invariant Lagrange density is complete. Derive the no monopoles law Plug the 16 terms of the Lagrange density into 20 slots in the Euler-Lagrange equations: This is a mountain of details. People are much better at spotting patterns. Do simple things, one at a time. Here is the first Euler-Lagrange equation: Only terms with phi matter. The derivative repeat. That's it. Here are the terms in the Lagrangian that have a phi: Every term with a phi is mixed. Derivatives of mixed terms is simple: Here's what happens: After Euler-Lagrange is applied, there is no phi left. There is 1 term in the numerator, and two partial derivatives. * All three spatial directions appear once. Using these three guides, you should be able to picture how the Lagrange density is changed by applying the Euler-Lagrange equation. With minuses in one column, and pluses in the other, cancellations happen: Focus on the example. See how the phi drops, and one has mixed derivatives with opposite signs. Nice. What is going on in terms of the E and B fields? Look at things row by row: The first line of the Lagrangian has two derivatives of phi with respect to x . After going through the Euler-Lagrange equation, one is left with a second order derivative which is the x derivative of the magnetic field. Rinse and repeat for y and z : These cancellations all happen because of a vector identity: the divergence of a curl is zero. Derive Faraday's law To continue down this longer road and arrive at Faraday's law, start from the same Lagrangian, but focus on the A x terms: The Euler-Lagrange will wipe out the A x 's, leading to cancellations. The top line is a time derivative of B x . The second and third lines together form the curl of E x . Here is the pattern: This is Faraday's law. Derive the Maxwell source equations The Maxwell source equations are Gauss' law and Ampere's law. A Lorentz invariant coupling of the current density to the potential is needed. That is simply the product of the current density with the potential: We also need a Lorentz invariant of the E and B fields. As discussed in EM invariants , the gauge-free derivative of a potential written in both orders does the trick: This is a difference of squares. We get the Poynting 3-vector created for free. This is not a minor addition. Neither of the fields E or B are changed if time is reversed. The square of the E field has two terms that flip signs, so effectively no sign flips, while the square of the B field has none. The same is not true of the Poynting vector. There is only one term with a time factor in the E field, so it would flip signs. One long standing riddle in physics is the perfect time symmetry in the Maxwell equations. Those equations start with only the difference of squares, not the Poynting vector. If, for the biggest complete vision, we need to consider both of these terms, a solution to the time symmetry riddle could be found. That is speculation, but worth pointing out. The plan Start by writing out the Lagrange density Write out E x and B x . Multiply it out. Clones E y , E z , B y , and B z . The Lagrange density Start easy by writing out E x and B x : Multiply it out. Every term is negative except the squares of the B x field. Continue the process for y and z . The electric field terms in yellow are simple substitutions. The magnetic field involves the curl, so it can be intimidating. Once one term is done, the rest follow from the pattern set for_ B x _ along with a \"no redundant\" requirement, much like a Sudoku puzzle. The Lagrange density needs the current coupling and the difference of the square of the fields. One detail is that a factor of a half is needed to simplify derivative equations There is a clean separation of electric fields (in yellow) and the magnetic field (in green and orange). The Lagrange density for the Maxwell source equations is complete. Derive Gauss's law. Start applying the Euler-Lagrange equation by focusing on terms with a phi in them: There is one current coupling term. There are six terms all coming from the electric field. This is reasonable because only the electric field has a phi, and the E and B fields are separated in the differences of squares EM Lagrangian. We need to do calculus on two types of terms. One is a square, the other is a mixed derivative: Even though these expressions look impressively complicated, one is only taking the derivatives of x 2 and xy, the first sorts of derivatives one learns in the study of calculus. It is x that is odd, being another derivative. Apply the Euler-Lagrange equation to all the terms with a phi: Here is the pattern: This is Gauss's law. Derive Ampere's law This time focus on terms on A x in the Lagrange density: Write out the Euler-Lagrange derivatives: Collect the terms generated by the Euler-Lagrange equations: Look at the pattern: This is Ampere's law. The big pictures Gauss's law is only about the electric field. Ampere's law is about both. The two Lagrangians and four Maxwell field equations together on one stage: Maxwell by hand To really lean anything, one needs to practice over and over, by hand. Here is a complete derivation of the Maxwell source equations using quaternions. Instead of picking the familiar Cartesian coordinates of t , x , y , and z , generalized coordiantes are used with the numbers 0-3. Copy this over until you can do so without looking at a reference image. Leave your practice sheets around where you work or study. People will presume you are a genius. A Complete Inner Product Space with Dirac's Bracket Notation A mathematical connection between the bracket notation of quantum mechanics and quaternions is detailed. It will be argued that quaternions have the properties of a complete inner-product space (a Banach space for the field of quaternions). A central issue is the definition of the square of the norm. In quantum mechanics: In this notebook, the following assertion will be examined (star is the conjugate, so the vector flips signs): The inner-product of two quaternions is defined here as the transpose (or conjugate) of the first quaternion multiplied by the second. The inner product of a function with itself is the norm. The Positive Definite Norm of a Quaternion The square of the norm of a quaternion can only be zero if every element is zero, otherwise it must have a positive value. This is the standard Euclidean norm for a real 4-dimensional vector space. The Euclidean inner-product of two quaternions can take on any value, as is the case in quantum mechanics for <phi|theta>. The adjective \"Euclidean\" is used to distinguish this product from the Grassman inner- product which plays a central role in special relativity (see alternative algebra for boosts). Completeness With the topology of a Euclidean norm for a real 4-dimensional vector space, quaternions are complete. Quaternions are complete in a manner required to form a Banach space if there exists a neighborhood of any quaternion x such that there is a set of quaternions y for some fixed value of epsilon. Construct such a neighborhood. An infinite number of quaternions exist in the neighborhood. Any polynomial equation with quaternion coefficients has a quaternion solution in x (a proof done by Eilenberg and Niven in 1944, cited in Birkhoff and Mac Lane's \"A Survey of Modern Algebra.\") Identities and Inequalities The following identities and inequalities emanate from the properties of a Euclidean norm. They are worked out for quaternions here in detail to solidify the connection between the machinery of quantum mechanics and quaternions. The conjugate of the square of the norm equals the square of the norm of the two terms reversed. For quaternions, These are identical, because the terms involving the cross produce will flip signs when their order changes. For products of squares of norms in quantum mechanics, This is also the case for quaternions. The triangle inequality in quantum mechanics: For quaternions, If the signs of each pair of component are the same, the two sides will be equal. If the signs are different (a t and a -t for example), then the cross terms will cancel on the left hand side of the inequality, making it smaller than the right hand side where terms never cancel because there are only squared terms. The Schwarz inequality in quantum mechanics is analogous to dot products and cosines in Euclidean space. Let a third wave function, chi, be the sum of these two with an arbitrary parameter lambda. The norm of chi will necessarily be greater than zero. Choose the value for lambda that helps combine all the terms containing lambda. Multiply through by the denominator, separate the two resulting terms and do some minor rearranging. This is now the Schwarz inequality. Another inequality: Examine the square of the norm of the difference between two quaternions which is necessarily equal to or greater than zero. The cross terms can be put on the other side of inequality, changing the sign, and leaving the sum of two norms behind. The inequality holds. The parallelogram law: Test the quaternion norm This is twice the square of the norms of the two separate components. Implications In the case for special relativity, it was noticed that by simply squaring a quaternion, the resulting first term was the Lorentz invariant interval. From that solitary observation, the power of a mathematical field was harnessed to solve a wide range of problems in special relativity. In a similar fashion, it is hoped that because the product of a transpose of a quaternion with a quaternion has the properties of a complete inner product space, the power of the mathematical field of quaternions can be used to solve a wide range of problems in quantum mechanics. This is an important area for further research. Note: this goal is different from the one Stephen Adler sets out in \"Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.\" He tries to substitute quaternions in the place of complex numbers in the standard Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. The analytical properties of quaternions do not play a critical role. It is the properties of the Hilbert space over the field of quaternions that is harnessed to solve problems. It is my opinion that since the product of a transpose of a quaternion with a quaternion already has the properties of a norm in a Hilbert space, there is no need to imbed quaternions again within another Hilbert space. I like a close shave with Occam's razor. Multiplying Quaternions in Polar Coordinate Form Any quaternion can be written in polar coordinate form, which involves a scalar magnitude and angle, and a 3-vector I (which in some cases can be the more familiar i). This representation can be useful due to the properties of the exponential function, cosines and sines. The absolute value of a quaternion is the square root of the norm, which is the transpose of a quaternion multiplied by itself. The angle is the arccosine of the ratio of the first component of a quaternion over the norm. The vector component is generated by normalizing the pure quaternion (the final three terms) to the norm of the pure quaternion. I 2 equals -1 just like i 2. Let (0, V) = (q - q*)/2. It should be possible to do Fourier analysis with quaternions, and to form a Dirac delta function (or distribution). That is a project for the future. Those tools are necessary for solving problems in quantum mechanics. New method for multiplying quaternion exponentials Multiplying two exponentials is at the heart of modern analysis, whether one works with Fourier transforms or Lie groups. Given a Lie algebra of a Lie group in a sufficiently small area the identity, the product of two exponentials can be defined using the Campbell-Hausdorff formula: This formula is not easy to use, and is only applicable in a small area around unity. Quaternion analysis that relies on this formula would be very limited. I have developed (perhaps for the first time) a simpler and general way to express the product of two quaternion exponentials as the sum of two components. The product of two quaternions splits into a commuting and an anti-commuting part. The rules for multiplying commuting quaternions are identical to those for complex numbers. The anticommuting part needs to be purely imaginary. The Grassman product (q q') of two quaternion exponentials and the Euclidean product (q* q') should both have these properties. Together these define the needs for the product of two quaternion exponentials. I call these operators \"conjugators\" because they involve taking the conjugate of the two elements. Andrew Millard made the suggestion for the Grassman product that unifies these approaches nicely. What is happening here is that both commuting and anticommuting parts scale themselves appropriately. By using an exponential that has pi/2 multiplied by a normalized quaternion, this always has a zero scalar, as it must to accurately represent an anticommuting part. Commutators and the Uncertainty Principle Commutators and the uncertainty principle are central to quantum mechanics. Using quaternions in these roles has already been established by others (Horwitz and Biedenharn, Annals of Physics, 157:432, 1984). The first proof of the uncertainty principle I saw relied solely on the properties of complex numbers, not on physics! In this notebook I will repeat that analysis, showing how commutators and an uncertainty principle arise from the properties of quaternions (or their subfield the complex numbers). Commutators Any quaternion can be written in a polar form. This is identical to Euler's formula except that the imaginary unit vector i is replaced by the normalized 3-vector. The two are equivalent if j = k = 0. Any quaternion could be the limit of the sum of an infinite number of other quaternions expressed in a polar form. I hope to show that such a quaternion mathematically behaves like the wave function of quantum mechanics, even if the notation is different. To simplify things, use a normalized quaternion, so that q q = 1. Collect the normalized 3-vector together with I = V/(V V)^.5. The angle s/(q* q)^.5 is a real number. Any real number can be viewed as the product of two other real numbers. This seemingly irrelevant observation lends much of the flexibility seen in quantum mechanics :-) Here is the rewrite of q. The unit vector I could also be viewed as the product of two quaternions.For classical quantum mechanics, this additional complication is unnecessary. It may be required for relativistic quantum mechanics, so this should be kept in mind. A point of clarification on notation:the same letter will be used 4 distinct ways.There are operators, A hat, which act on a quaternion wave function by multiplying by a quaternion, capital A. If the operator A hat is an observable, then it generates a real number, (a, 0), which commutes with all quaternions, whatever their form. There is also a variable with respect to a component of a quaternion, a_i, that can be used to form a differential operator. Define a linear operator A hat that multiplies q by the quaternion A. If the operator A hat is an observable, then the quaternion A is a real number, (a, 0). This will commute with any quaternion. This equation is functionally equivalent to an eigenvalue equation, with A hat as an eigenvector of q and (a, 0) as the eigenvalue. However, all of the components of this equation are quaternions, not separate structures such as an operator belonging to a group and a vector. This might make a subtle but significant difference for the mathematical structure of the theory, a point that will not be investigated here. Define a linear operator B hat that multiplies q by the quaternion B. If B hat is an observable, then this operator can be defined in terms of the scalar variable a. Operators A and B are linear. Calculate the commutator [A, B], which involves the scalar a and the derivative with respect to a. The commutator acting on a quaternion is equivalent to multiplying that quaternion by the normalized 3-vector I. The Uncertainty Principle Use these operators to construct things that behave like averages (expectation values) and standard deviations. The scalar a--generated by the observable operator A hat acting on the normalized q--can be calculated using the Euclidean product. It is hard to shuffle quaternions or their operators around. Real scalars commute with any quaternion and are their own conjugates. Operators that generate such scalars can move around. Look at ways to express the expectation value of A. Define a new operator A' based on A whose expectation value is always zero. Define the square of the operator in a way designed to link up with the standard deviation. An identical set of tools can be defined for B. In the section on bracket notation, the Schwarz inequality for quaternions was shown. The Schwarz inequality applies to quaternions, not quaternion operators. If the operators A' and B' are surrounded on both sides by q and q*, then they will behave like scalars. The left-hand side of the Schwarz inequality can be rearranged to form a commutator. The right-hand side of the Schwarz inequality can be rearranged to form the square of the standard deviation operators. Plug both of these back into the Schwarz inequality, stripping the primes and the q's which appear on both sides along the way. This is the uncertainty principle for complementary observable operators. Connections to Standard Notation This quaternion exercise can be mapped to the standard notation used in physics One subtlety to note is that a quaternion operator is anti-Hermitian only if the scalar is zero. This is probably the case for classical quantum mechanics, but quantum field theory may require full quaternion operators. The proof of the uncertainty principle shown here is independent of this issue. I do not yet understand the consequence of this point. To get to the position-momentum uncertainty equation, make these specific maps The product of the squares of the standard deviation for position and momentum in the x-direction has a lower bound equal to half the expectation value of the commutator of those operators. The proof is in the structure of quaternions. Implications There are many interpretations of the uncertainty principle. I come away with two strange observations. First, the uncertainty principle is about quaternions of the form q = Exp[a b I]. With this insight, one can see by inspection that a plane wave Exp[((Et - P.X)/hbar I], or wave packets that are superpositions of plane waves, will have four uncertainty relations, one for the scalar Et and another three for the three-part scalar P.X. This perspective should be easy to generalize. Second, the uncertainty principle and gravity are related to the same mathematical properties. This proof of the uncertainty relation involved the Schwarz inequality. It is fairly straightforward to convert that inequality to the triangle inequality. Finding geodesics with quaternions involves the triangle inequality. If a complete theory of gravity can be built from these geodesics (it hasn't yet been done :-) then the inequalities may open connections where none appeared before. Unifying the Representation of Spin and Angular Momentum I will show how to represent both integral and half-integral spin within the same quaternion algebraic field. This involves using quaternion automorphisms. First a sketch of why this might work will be provided. Second, small rotations in a plane around two axes will be used to show how the resulting vector points in an opposite way, depending on which involution is used to construct the infinitesimal rotation. Finally, a general identity will be used to look at what happens under exchange of two quaternions in a commutator. Automorphism, Rotations, and Commutators Quaternions are formed from the direct product of a scalar and a 3-vector. Rotational operators that act on each of the 3 components of the 3-vector act like integral angular momentum. I will show that a rotation operator that acts differently on two of the three components of the 3-vector acts like half-integral spin. What happens with the scalar is irrelevant to this dimensional counting. The same rotation matrix acting on the same quaternion behaves differently depending directly on what involutions are involved. Quaternions have 4 degrees of freedom. If we want to represent quaternions with automorphisms, 4 are required: They are the identity automorphism, the conjugate anti-automorphism, the first conjugate anti-automorphism, and the second conjugate anti-automorphism: where e1, e2, e3 are orthogonal basis vectors The most important automorphism is the identity. Life is stable around small permutations of the identity:-) The conjugate flips the signs of the each component in the 3-vector. These two automorphisms, the identity and the conjugate, treat the 3-vector as a unit. The first and second conjugate flip the signs of all terms but the first and second terms, respectively. Therefore these operators act on only the two of the three components in the 3-vector. By acting on only two of three components, a commutator will behave differently. This small difference in behavior inside a commutator is what creates the ability to represent integral and half-integral spins. Small Rotations Small rotations about the origin will now be calculated. These will then be expressed in terms of the four automorphisms discussed above. I will be following the approach used in J. J. Sakurai's book \"Modern Quantum Mechanics\", chapter 3, making modifications necessary to accommodate quaternions. First, consider rotations about the origin in the z axis. Define: Two technical points. First, Sakurai considered rotations around any point along the z axis. This analysis is confined to the z axis at the origin, a significant but not unreasonable constraint. Second, these rotations are written with generalized coordinates instead of the very familiar and comfortable x, y, z. This extra effort will be useful when considering how rotations are effected by curved spacetime. This machinery is also necessary to do quaternion analysis (please see that section, it's great :-) There are similar rotations around the first and second axes at the origin; Consider an infinitesimal rotation for these three rotation operators. To second order in theta, Calculate the commutator of the first two infinitesimal rotation operators to second order in theta: To second order, the commutator of infinitesimal rotations of rotations about the first two axes equals twice one rotation about the third axis given the squared angle minus a zero rotation about an arbitrary axis (a fancy way to say the identity). Now I want to write this result using anti-automorphic involutions for the small rotation operators. Nothing has changed. Repeat this exercise one last time for the first conjugate: This points exactly the opposite way,even for an infinitesimal angle! This is the kernel required to form a unified representation of integral and half integral spin. Imagine adding up a series of these small rotations, say 2 pi of these. No doubt the identity and conjugates will bring you back exactly where you started. The first and second conjugates in the commutator will point in the opposite direction. To get back on course will require another 2 pi, because the minus of a minus will generate a plus. Automorphic Commutator Identities This is a very specific example. Is there a general identity behind this work? Here it is: It is usually a good sign if a proposal gets more subtle by generalization :-) In this case, the negative sign seen on the z axis for the first conjugate commutator is due to the action of an additional first conjugate. For the first conjugate, the first term will have the correct sign after a 2 pi journey, but the scalar, third and forth terms will point the opposite way. A similar, but not identical story applies for the second conjugate. With the identity, we can see exactly what happens if q changes places with q' with a commutator. Notice, I stopped right at the commutator (not including any additional conjugator). In that case: Under an exchange, the identity and conjugate commutators form a distinct group from the commutators formed with the first and second conjugates. The behavior in a commutator under exchange of the identity automorphism and the anti-automorphic conjugate are identical. The first and second conjugates are similar, but not identical. There are also corresponding identities for the anti-commutator: At this point, I don't know how to use them, but again, the identity and first conjugates appear to behave differently that the first and second conjugates. Implications This is not a super-symmetric proposal. For that work, there is a super- partner particle for every currently detected particle. At this time, not one of those particles has been detected, a serious omission. Three different operators had to be blended together to perform this feat: commutators, conjugates and rotations. These involve issue of even/oddness, mirrors, and rotations. In a commutator under exchange of two quaternions, the identity and the conjugate behave in a united way, while the first and second conjugates form a similar, but not identical set. Because this is a general quaternion identity of automorphisms, this should be very widely applicable. Deriving A Quaternion Analog to the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation The Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives the kinetic energy plus the potential (a sum also known as the Hamiltonian H) of the wave function psi, which contains all the dynamical information about a system. Psi is a scalar function with complex values. For the time-independent case, energy is written at the operator -i hbar d/dt, and kinetic energy as the square of the momentum operator, i hbar Del, over 2m. Given the potential V(0, X) and suitable boundary conditions, solving this differential equation generates a wave function psi which contains all the properties of the system. In this section, the quaternion analog to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation will be derived from first principles. What is interesting are the constraint that are required for the quaternion analog. For example, there is a factor which might serve to damp runaway terms. The Quaternion Wave Function The derivation starts from a curious place :-) Write out classical angular momentum with quaternions. What makes this \"classical\" are the zeroes in the scalars. Make these into complete quaternions by bringing in time to go along with the space 3-vector R, and E with the 3-vector P. Define a dimensionless quaternion psi that is this product over h bar. The scalar part of psi is also seen in plane wave solutions of quantum mechanics. The complicated 3-vector is a new animal, but notice it is composed of all the parts seen in the scalar, just different permutations that evaluate to 3-vectors. One might argue that for completeness, all combinations of E, t, R and P should be involved in psi, as is the case here. Any quaternion can be expressed in polar form: Express psi in polar form. To make things simpler, assume that psi is normalized, so |psi| = 1. The 3-vector of psi is quite complicated, so define one symbol to capture it: Now rewrite psi in polar form with these simplifications: This is what I call the quaternion wave function. Unlike previous work with quaternionic quantum mechanics (see S. Adler's book \"Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics\"), I see no need to define a vector space with right-hand operator multiplication. As was shown in the section on bracket notation, the Euclidean product of psi (psi* psi) will have all the properties required to form a Hilbert space. The advantage of keeping both operators and the wave function as quaternions is that it will make sense to form an interacting field directly using a product such as psi psi'. That will not be done here. Another advantage is that all the equations will necessarily be invertible. Changes in the Quaternion Wave Function We cannot derive the Schr\u00f6dinger equation per se, since that involves Hermitian operators that acting on a complex vector space. Instead, the operators here will be anti-Hermitian quaternions acting on quaternions. Still it will look very similar, down to the last h bar :-) All that needs to be done is to study how the quaternion wave function psi changes. Make the following assumptions. 1. Energy and Momentum are conserved. Energy is evenly distributed in space 3. The system is isolated 4. The position 3-vector X is in the same direction as the momentum 3-vector P The implications of this last assumption are not obvious but can be computed directly by taking the appropriate derivative. Here is a verbal explanation. If energy and momentum are conserved, they will not change in time. If the position 3-vector which does change is always in the same direction as the momentum 3-vector, then I will remain constant in time. Since I is in the direction of X, its curl will be zero. This last constraint may initially appear too confining. Contrast this with the typical classical quantum mechanics. In that case, there is an imaginary factor i which contains no information about the system. It is a mathematical tool tossed in so that the equation has the correct properties. With quaternions, I is determined directly from E, t, P and X. It must be richer in information content. This particular constraint is a reflection of that. Now take the time derivative of psi. The denominator must be at least 1, and can be greater that that. It can serve as a damper, a good thing to tame runaway terms. Unfortunately, it also makes solving explicitly for energy impossible unless Et - P.X equals zero. Since the goal is to make a direct connection to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, make one final assumption: There are several important cases when this will be true. In a vacuum, E and P are zero. If this is used to study photons, then t = |R| and E = |P|. If this number happens to be constant in time, then this equation will apply to the wave front. Now with these 5 assumptions in hand, energy can be defined with an operator. The equivalence of the energy E and this operator is called the first quantization. Take the spatial derivative of psi using the under the same assumptions: Square this operator. The Hamiltonian equals the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. Typographically, this looks very similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Capital I is a normalized 3-vector, and a very complicated one at that if you review the assumptions that got us here. phi is not a vector, but is a quaternion. This give the equation more, not less, analytical power. With all of the constraints in place, I expect that this equation will behave exactly like the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. As the constraints are removed, this proposal becomes richer. There is a damper to quench runaway terms. The 3-vector I becomes quite the nightmare to deal with, but it should be possible, given we are dealing with a topological algebraic field. Implications Any attempt to shift the meaning of an equation as central to modern physics had first be able to regenerate all of its results. I believe that the quaternion analog to Schr\u00f6dinger equation under the listed constraints will do the task. These is an immense amount of work needed to see as the constraints are relaxed, whether the quaternion differential equations will behave better. My sense at this time is that first quaternion analysis as discussed earlier must be made as mathematically solid as complex analysis. At that point, it will be worth pushing the envelope with this quaternion equation. If it stands on a foundation as robust as complex analysis, the profound problems seen in quantum field theory stand a chance of fading away into the background. Introduction to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics The relativistic quantum mechanic equation for a free particle is the Klein- Gordon equation (h=c=1) The Schr\u00f6dinger equation results from the non-relativistic limit of this equation. In this section, the machinery of the Klein-Gordon equation will be ported to quaternions. The Wave Function The wave function is the superposition of all possible states of a system. The product of the conjugate of a wave function with another wave function forms a complete inner product space. In the energy/momentum representation, this would involve all possible energy levels and momenta. This infinite sum of quaternions should contain all the information about a system. The quaternion wave function can be normalized. The first quaternion is the conjugate or transpose of the second. Since the transpose of a quaternion wave function times a wave function creates a Euclidean norm, this representation of wave functions as an infinite sum of quaternions can form a complete, normed product space. The Klein-Gordon Equation The Klein-Gordon equation can be divided into two operators that act on the wave function: the D'Alembertian and the scalar m 2 . The quaternion operator required to create the D'Alembertian, along with vector identities, has already been worked out for the Maxwell equations in the Lorenz gauge. The first term of the scalar, and the second term of the vector, are both equal to zero. What is left is the D'Alembertian operator acting on the quaternion wave function. To generate the scalar multiplier m 2 , substitute En and Pn for the operators d/dt and del respectively, and repeat. Since the structure of the operator is identical to the previous one, instead of the D'Alembertian times the wave function, there is En 2 -Pn 2 . The sum of all these terms becomes m 2 . Set the sum of these two operators equal to zero to form the Klein-Gordon equation. It takes some skilled staring to assure that this equation contains the Klein- Gordon equation along with vector identities. Connection to the Maxwell Equations If m=0, the quaternion operators of the Klein-Gordon equation simplifies to the operators used to generate the Maxwell equations in the Lorenz gauge. In the homogeneous case, the same operator acting on two different quaternions equals the same result. This implies that Under this interpretation, a nonzero mass changes the wave equation into a simple harmonic oscillator. The simple relationship between the quaternion potential and the wave function may hold for the nonhomogeneous case as well. Implications The Klein-Gordon equation is customarily viewed as a scalar equation (due to the scalar D'Alembertian operator) and the Maxwell equations are a vector equation (due to the potential four vector). In this notebook, the quaternion operator that generated the Maxwell equations was used to generate the Klein- Gordon equation. This also created several vector identities which are usually not mentioned in this context. A quaternion differential equation is needed to perform the work of the Dirac equation, but since quaternion operators are a field, an operator that does the task must exist. An Introduction to the Standard Model The Standard Model of physics was developed in the 1970's to explain the ~270 different types of particles seen in colliders (a general introduction is available on wikipedia , and a one page cheat sheet ). The part we need to understand is the groups that describe the symmetry of the standard model. What is a group? A group has an identity, an inverse, and a binary operation (multiplication). One member of the group times another member of the group generates yet another member of the same group. This is a case where the math name is accurate: once in a group, you are always in a group. The standard model has three continuous groups that characterize three of the four known fundamental forces of nature. The simplest group is known as U(1) and governs electromagnetism via the photon. The reason there is one photon is that the Lie algebra u(1) - note that was a small u! - has one degree of freedom. This group is called the unary group , complex numbers with a norm of 1. The members of this group commute, so it does not matter the order things are written in. Quaternions have this property only when all point in the same or opposite directions, which is the case for when using one quaternion times itself. The continuous group SU(2) rules the weak force, the stuff driving radioactive decay. Mathematically this is call unitary quaternions, quaternions with a norm of 1. The Lie algebra used to generate this group has three degrees of freedom. That is why the weak force is mediated by three particles, the W+, W-, and the Z. The group SU(3) is for the strong force whose residual interactions keep nuclei together. Its Lie algebra has eight members, and there are eight gluons. Animations of Groups Start with a simple picture, layer pictures together, and we will be able to see what the standard model of particle physics looks like. S0 - So simple! This is the symmetry of +/-R, one number. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is This is (-1, 0, 0, 0) and (+1, 0, 0, 0). It sits in the center, as quaternions of the form (n, 0, 0, 0) like to do. [S1 - The Circle](http://www.theworld.com/%7Esweetser/quaternions/quantum /standard_model/S1) Now we let the sum of squares of 2 numbers equal 1. This creates a circle. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is The circle could have any orientation in 3D space. The program choose one at random. S2 - Slice of an Expanding/Contracting Sphere The sum of squares of 3 numbers equal 1. A quaternion has four numbers. One approach to representing S2 is to set t=0. You get the standard sphere, but only at the instant of t=0. Blink! What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is That looks like a typical sphere, except it doesn't last long. Three straight lines appear in the \"what was\" graph because time is fixed. Another way to represent S2 is to set x=0. Then you have an edge view of an expanding circle. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Only the \"what was left/right\" graph has a fixed, straight line graph, because x=0. If z=0, at least you can see the \"circleness\" What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is In the \"what was\" graphs, it is easy to spot which dimension is set to zero: it is the straight line. S3 - A Quaternion Sphere Now use all 4 terms, and fill in the sphere in both time and space! What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is SU(2) - Like S2, the Partial Sphere The graphs of S2 were all paper thin or fleeting. They do not \"fill up\" spacetime. The next graph, generated by putting random quaternions into the expression exp(q-q*), fills up spacetime. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Although more of spacetime appears filled, only places were time is greater than zero have a chance to have an event. U(1)xSU(2) - Like the Complete Quaternion Sphere S3 SU(2) has only three of the four degrees of freedom available to a quaternion. There is no way to fill up all of spacetime with just SU(2). Now fill spacetime in by multiplying by itself, or q/|q| exp(q-q*) What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Most of the points cluster on the negative side of the time line. U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) - The Standard Model The question is how to generate SU(3)? It has a Lie algebra su(3) that has eight elements. Based on work done on quaternion quantum mechanics, it is clear I need to work with the conjugate of one quaternion times another, what I call the Euclidean product, because q q generates the norm of a quaternion q, (t2 + x2 + y2 + z2, 0, 0, 0). If we have 2 different quaternions, q and q', we can write them as q q' as U(1)xSU(2): (q/|q| exp(q-q )) (q'/|q'| exp(q'-q' )). Here is its animation: What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Notice how all of spacetime is filled evenly with events. A product of two quaternions that uses a conjugate different from a standard product because multiplication is no longer associative ((a b) c does not equal a (b c)). The norms are preserved, so the norm will remain 1. Eight independent number are used to make something with a norm of one. The identity is 1, and all elements have an inverse under what I call \"Euclidean multiplication\", q q'. Based on the animation, the group is compact and simply connected. All of this traits contribute to the conclusion that the symmetry of the standard model can be represented by quaternions in this way. It would be great to include gravity, which is all about how measurements change as one moves around a differentiable 4D manifold. Include the metric as part of the calculation of a quaternion product. The group Diff(M) is all diffeomorphisms of a compact smooth manifold. It is at the heart of general relativity. One can imagine this spacetime filling sphere on any compact smooth manifold. What happens if q=q'? That is shown below: What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is The standard model is about the group symmetry of the quaternion multiplication identity in spacetime. OK, but what does that mean? Here is my take. Observers sit at here-now in spacetime, or numerically at (0, 0, 0, 0). An observer sees something out there, and tries to characterize the \"thingie\". The basic bit of information it can classify is an event. Whatever set of events is collected, they are all tied up in describing this one thingie out there. Every event contributes to the description of the thingie, and so makes a group. The multiplicative identity of a quaternion, (1, 0, 0, 0) is a way to represent the thingie. Almost none of the events map to (1, 0, 0, 0). The events are scattered all around spacetime. U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) is the way to cow-rope all the events and bring them home, while remaining part of the same group, the one thing being observed. Time Reversal Transformations for Intervals Classical Time Reversal Relativistic Time Reversal Implications The following transformation R for quaternions reverses time: The quaternion R exist because quaternions are a field. R will equal (-t, X )(t, . The inverse of quaternion is the transpose over the square of the norm, which is the scalar term of the transpose of a quaternion times itself. For any given time, R can be defined based on the above. Classical Time Reversal Examine the form of the quaternion which reverses time under two conditions. A interval normalized to the interval takes the form (1, beta), a scalar one and a 3-vector relativistic velocity beta . In the classical region, beta<<<1. Calculate R in this limit to one order of magnitude in beta. The operator R is almost the negative identity, but the vector is non-zero, so it would not commute. Relativistic Time Reversal For a relativistic interval involving one axis, the interval could be characterized by the following: Find out what quaternion is required to reverse time for this relativistic interval to first order in epsilon\u0013. This approaches q[-e/T, 1, 0, 0], almost a pure vector, a result distinct from the classical case. Implications In special relativity, the interval between events is considered to be 4 vector are operated on by elements of the Lorentz group. The element of this group that reverses time has along its diagonal {-1, 1, 1, 1}, zeroes elsewhere. There is no dependence on relative velocity. Therefore special relativity predicts the operation of time reversal should be indistinguishable for classical and relativistic intervals. Yet classically, time reversal appears to involve entropy, and relativistically, time reversal involves antiparticles. In this notebook, a time reversal quaternion has been derived and shown to work. Time reversal for classical and relativistic intervals have distinct limits, but these transformations have not yet been tied explicitly to the laws of physics. Buttons | | | | | -- | -- | -- | | | | | Promote the Doing Physics with Quaternions Project, and look cool :-) These 5 buttons represent a visual presentation of some of the key ideas behind my efforts to unify gravity and electromagnetism. Fine cuisine depends on starting with the best ingredients. Great physics depends on using new powerful math. An event in space-time has one dimension for time and three dimensions for space, the most powerful tool would be a generalized number that can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided, but has four parts to it. There is one such number called a quaternion, shown here. Time is t, and x, y, and z are the values the event may have in the three directions, i, j, and k. Quaternions are the mathematical foundation for all my efforts in theoretical physics. A person standing on a scale in a closed box could not tell the difference between the box sitting on the surface of the Earth or the box accelerating at the same rate as the Earth's gravity in a rocket ship as depicted here. Einstein called this the equivalence principle, but it only applied to mass, not charge. The General Equivalence Principle extends this idea of fooling observers to cover any measurement. The box mathematically means \"all the changes in time and space.\" One can ask, what are all the possible changes in the direction rulers (I) and the potential (A), or Box IA? The usual answer is the rulers are fixed and it is the potential that changes, I Box A. However, the answer could also be the potential is the same, but the rulers are changing, A Box I. A unified field theory describes light and gravity in the same equation. Einstein spent the last half of his life looking for one, but did not succeed. The equation on the right reads in mathlish, \"The change in the change in the potential equals some constants times the source.\" The stars are involved in games with plus and minus signs. It takes work to see that the signs are correct. A unified field theory must be able to describe all forms of change. The graphic tries to depict this: changes in a square grid, changes moving straight out from the center, changes that are circular ripples, and changes that are spirals. The graphic does not show changes in time or the third dimension. It is only a graphic after all. The standard model is used to quantify why there are this many of that kind of subatomic particle, and that many of those particles. A vast amount of exquisite detail is explained. No one has justified why the standard model should be this way. The standard model is constructed from what are called symmetry groups which go by the names U(1), SU(2), and SU(3). The quaternion unified field theory can be written in a way that lines up perfectly with two of these symmetries. The connection to the SU(3) symmetry is unclear now, although technically it has the right number of fingers and toes (eight in this case). Newton's law of gravity works to explain the rotation of the Moon around the Earth. Newton's law of gravity works to explain the velocity of stars near the center of a galaxy, but fails to explain why stars further from the center maintain that same velocity. One hypothesis is called dark matter, stuff that cannot be seen but makes the velocities work out just so. All physics laws must respect relativity and the rules of calculus. These rules create the second term which has a constant velocity and accurately describes the distribution of mass with respect to the radius, no dark matter required.

My mother went to Boston University getting a degree in Physical Therapy. They had one poor date in a canoe. While in Europe, my father tracked down my mother, and with nearly all the details lost to me, wooed her accross the pond. I was born in Bronxville, New York, in 1962. We had both a stay at home mom and live in maid. My father worked at the New York Times a corporate lawyer. When I was five, he got a job at the Minneapolis Star and Tribune. The family moved into a house with almost 10 acres of land. I went to a The Blake School an all boys private school, until it became the plural Blake Schools and coed in seventh grade (great timing). My education continued at M.I.T. where I got degrees in Biology and Chemical engineering. Note: I did not get a degree in either mathematics or physics. I am a solid core nerd. A hard core nerd has strong opinions about all the versions of Star Trek. A solid core nerd does not watch the show because the science is so impossibly wrong. In Star Trek, space is treated like Manhattan: go to the next stop, and a wonderfully different collection of people are there. One can easy go from Wall Street Suits, to Chinatown, to Uptown, to Harlem, Spanish or otherwise. Space in the Universe is really just space, with distances too far for people to travel.

Brandeis, 2000-2002 MS: Computer Software Engineering Work Experience Biology My first job was as a lab tech at the newly opened Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. On the first week on the job, Prof. Rick Young showed me how to clone the first genes ever from the Mycobacteria that causes leprosy. The work was featured on a NOVA documentary. Twelve technical papers were written in a three year paper in the most important journals in biology, including Nature, Cell, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Worked as a lab tech for Jac Nickoloff at the Harvard School of Public Health (8 years). My heart was elsewhere (which caused problems on the job). Computers The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) was started in Brookline, MA in 1989. They were my first ISP. After leaving the biology business, I worked the phones in a support role. I also helped maintain the billing software written in Perl. The shifting landscape of ISPs lead then to downsize in 2003. I was the 9th employee of Black Duck Software. They initially wanted to help companies understand the licensing requirements behind open source software. I was hired as a \"spider\", crawling the Internet and harvesting open source software for our knowledgebase. Physics Initial interest In the Christmas of 1988, both my mother and sister independently bought the book: \"A Brief History of Time\" by Stephen Hawking. I view that as my \"born again\" moment, one based on physics, not the Bible. For a month long period, my mind kept rearranging information, sure that everything somehow made sense. I was aware I was babbling - saying words that are part of the lexicon of physics, but would not make sense to an actual physicist. I decide to keep a day job, but work study physics in the background. Boston was the perfect city in the 1990s to study physics on the side. I took a Harvard Extension class on Special Relativity taught by Edwin F. Taylor as he was writing the book \"Spacetime Physics\" with Johnathon Wheeler. Taylor would bring in a new chapter from Copy Copy, and we were assigned to critique it. Thus became my respectful skeptical analysis of physics. I decide to keep a day job, but work study physics in the background. I was able to show some of my earliest efforts to a famous physicist who worked at MIT. He said it was \"interesting, but not very interesting\". The reason was I did not have a theory, a means to make many calculations. At the time, all I had were a few math widgets. First work on quaternions In the struggle to find a theory, I held a small contest on a moderated newsgroup, sci.physics.research in 1997. I asked readers to provide a brief definition of time. It had to be about math or physics, not philosophy, and needed to be two sentences or less. In one math book, I recalled some odd sort of number that was like a scalar and a vector. The contest motivated me to reread that passage, then go to an old-fashion library and read up about quaternions. This was the first equation I saw, the squaring of a quaternion: To this day, this makes me excited because the first term is at the core of special relativity as taught to me by Edwin F. Taylor. It is there, for free. That cannot be an accident. That observation drove me to purchase the domain quaternions.com. Major failure at a unified field theory I struggled to come up with a way to deal with gravity using only quaternions. One lesson from general relativity is that a theory of gravity must be a metric theory - a theory where the calculation of distance depends on where one happens to be in a gravitational field. Measuring distance is a symmetric operation, meaning there is no handed to doing the work. Quaternions do have a handedness. There is no way around that. So I reinvented hypercomplex numbers. Those have all the same multiplication rules as quaternions, but no minus signs anywhere. As such, hypercomplex numbers could be used to characterize a metric. I confess to having pride in the proposal, enough to print up t-shirts. It was difficult to find a professional to review the body of work. I began blogging on Science20.com. There I found a few technically skilled readers. When I finally got to presenting what I called the GEM proposal, several readers objected to the work. It took a little over a month for me to really see the proposal like they did. The flaw was deadly. A Lagrangian constructed from quaternions will not change under a rotation. It will therefore conserve angular momentum. A Lagrangian constructed from hypercomplex numbers will change under a rotation. It will not conserve angular momentum. Kepler's law of equal area in equal time is a statement that gravity conserves angular momentum. Thus a proposal for gravity using hypercomplex number in the Lagrangian is wrong. End of story. Current research Web sites: Quaternions.com , the mothership of my private research project. Numbers 101 , a visual introduction to space-time numbers, aka quaternions. Measurement 101 , a site dedicated to my new proposal for quaternion gravity VisualPhysics.org has a collection of analytic animations generated with a user-hostile set of tools I wrote. Quaternion space-times-time invariance as gravity I went back to the equation that sparked my initial interest in quaternions: The first term is called the interval. But what are the next three called? Physics doesn't have a name. That is a problem because the first term is one of the most important in physics because it is at the heart of special relativity. I came up with a reasonable name for the three amigos: space-times-time. I asked a simple question: what if space-times-time was invariant, then what sort of physics results? That could be gravity, but a very different theory because it is not a field theory. There would be no graviton, nor any quantum gravity theory. The idea had enough promise that I submitted an 1500 word paper to the 2015 Gravitation Research Foundation Essay on Gravity. We will see if they like it. Thanks to ...

A theorist can import very powerful tools to generate patterns, like metrics and group theory. Theorists in physics have been able to construct the most accurate models of nature in all of science. I hope to bring the full power of mathematics down to the level of the events themselves. This may be done by representing events as the mathematical field of quaternions. All the standard tools for creating mathematical patterns - multiplication, trigonometric functions, transcendental functions, infinite series, the special functions of physics - should be available for quaternions.

As Feynman pointed out, \"whatever we are allowed to imagine in science must be consistent with everything else we know.\" Fresh perspectives arise because, in essence, tensors of different rank can mix within the same equation. The four Maxwell equations become one nonhomogeneous quaternion wave equation, and the Klein-Gordon equation is part of a quaternion simple harmonic oscillator.

An obvious question was that if a rule for multiplying two numbers together was known, what about multiplying three numbers? For over a decade, this simple question had bothered Hamilton, the big mathematician of his day. The pressure to find a solution was not merely from within. Hamilton wrote to his son: Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month [Oct. 1843] on my coming down to breakfast, your brother William Edwin and yourself used to ask me, 'Well, Papa, can you multiply triplets?' Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of the head, 'No, I can only add and subtract them.' We can guess how Hollywood would handle the Brougham Bridge scene in Dublin. Strolling along the Royal Canal with Mrs. H-, he realizes the solution to the problem, jots it down in a notebook. So excited, he took out a knife and carved the answer in the stone of the bridge. Hamilton had found a long sought-after solution, but it was weird, very weird, it was 4D. One of the first things Hamilton did was get rid of the fourth dimension, setting it equal to zero, and calling the result a \"proper quaternion.\" He spent the rest of his life trying to find a use for quaternions. By the end of the nineteenth century, quaternions were viewed as an oversold novelty. In the early years of this century, Prof. Gibbs of Yale found a use for proper quaternions by reducing the extra fluid surrounding Hamilton's work and adding key ingredients from Rodrigues concerning the application to the rotation of spheres. He ended up with the vector dot product and cross product we know today. This was a useful and potent brew. Our investment in vectors is enormous, eclipsing their place of birth (Harvard had >1000 references under \"vector\", about 20 under \"quaternions\", most of those written before the turn of the century). In the early years of this century, Albert Einstein found a use for four dimensions. In order to make the speed of light constant for all inertial observers, space and time had to be united. Here was a topic tailor-made for a 4D tool, but Albert was not a math buff, and built a machine that worked from locally available parts. We can say now that Einstein discovered Minkowski spacetime and the Lorentz transformation, the tools required to solve problems in special relativity. Today, quaternions are of interest to historians of mathematics. Vector analysis performs the daily mathematical routine that could also be done with quaternions. I personally think that there may be 4D roads in physics that can be efficiently traveled only by quaternions, and that is the path which is laid out in these web pages. In a longer history, Gauss would get the credit for seeing quaternions first in one of his notebooks. Rodrigues developed 3D rotations all on his own also in the 1840's. The Pauli spin matrices and Penrose's spinors are reinventions of the wheel that miss out on division. Although I believe that is a major omission and cause of subtle flaws at the foundations of modern physics, spin matrices and spinors have many more adherents today than quaternions.","title":"A Brief History of Quaternions"},{"location":"doing_physics/#multiplying-quaternions-the-easy-way","text":"Multiplying two complex numbers a + b I and c + d I is straightforward.

Note that the last term, the cross product, would change its sign if the order of multiplication were reversed (unlike all the other terms). That is why quaternions in general do not commute. If a is the operator d/dt, and B is the del operator, or d/dx I + d/dy J + d/dz K (all partial derivatives), then these operators act on the scalar function c and the 3-vector function D in the following manner: This one quaternion contains the time derivatives of the scalar and 3-vector functions, along with the divergence, the gradient and the curl.

Each of these products can be separated into two parts: a symmetric (inner product) and an antisymmetric (outer product) components. The symmetric component will remain unchanged by exchanging the places of the quaternions, while the antisymmetric component will change its sign. Together they add up to the product.

I have defined the anticommutator (the bold curly braces) in a non-standard way, including a factor of two so I do not have to keep remembering to write it. The first term would be the Lorentz invariant interval if the two quaternions represented the same difference between two events in spacetime (i.e. t=t'=delta t,...). The invariant interval plays a central role in special relativity. The vector terms are a frame-dependent, symmetric product of space with time and does not appear on the stage of physics, but is still a valid measurement.

Whatever the interpretation, the Grassman and Euclidean inner and outer products seem destined to do useful work in physics.","title":"Implications"},{"location":"doing_physics/#scalars-vectors-tensors-and-all-that","text":"According to my math dictionary, a tensor is ... An abstract object having a definitely specified system of components in every coordinate system under consideration and such that, under transformation of coordinates, the components of the object undergoes a transformation of a certain nature. To make this introduction less abstract, I will confine the discussion to the simplest tensors under rotational transformations. A rank-0 tensor is known as a scalar. It does not change at all under a rotation. It contains exactly one number, never more or less. There is a zero index for a scalar. A rank-1 tensor is a vector. A vector does change under rotation. Vectors have one index which can run from 1 to the number of dimensions of the field, so there is no way to know a priori how many numbers (or operators, or ...) are in a vector. n-rank tensors have n indices. The number of numbers needed is the number of dimensions in the vector space raised by the rank. Symmetry can often simplify the number of numbers actually needed to describe a tensor. There are a variety of important spin-offs of a standard vector. Dual vectors, when multiplied by its corresponding vector, generate a real number, by systematically multiplying each component from the dual vector and the vector together and summing the total. If the space a vector lives in is shrunk, a contravariant vector shrinks, but a covariant vector gets larger. A tangent vector is, well, tangent to a vector function. Physics equations involve tensors of the same rank. There are scalar equations, polar vector equations, axial vector equations, and equations for higher rank tensors. Since the same rank tensors are on both sides, the identity is preserved under a rotational transformation. One could decide to arbitrarily combine tensor equations of different rank, and they would still be valid under the transformation. There are ways to switch ranks. If there are two vectors and one wants a result that is a scalar, that requires the intervention of a metric to broker the transaction. This process in known as an inner tensor product or a contraction. The vectors in question must have the same number of dimensions. The metric defines how to form a scalar as the indices are examined one-by- one. Metrics in math can be anything, but nature imposes constraints on which ones are important in physics. An aside: mathematicians require that the distance is non-negative, but physicists do not. I will be using the physics notion of a metric. In looking at events in spacetime (a 4-dimensional vector), the axioms of special relativity require the Minkowski metric, which is a 4x4 real matrix that has (1, -1, -1, -1) down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Some people prefer the signs to be flipped, but to be consistent with everything else on this site, I choose this convention. Another popular choice is the Euclidean metric, which is the same as an identity matrix. The result of general relativity for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass is the Schwarzschild metric, which has \"non-one\" terms down the diagonal, zeros elsewhere, and becomes the Minkowski metric in the limit of the mass going to zero or the radius going to infinity. An outer tensor product is a way to increase the rank of tensors. The tensor product of two vectors will be a 2-rank tensor. A vector can be viewed as the tensor product of a set of basis vectors.","title":"Scalars, Vectors, Tensors and All That"},{"location":"doing_physics/#what-are-quaternions","text":"Quaternions could be viewed as the outer tensor product of a scalar and a 3-vector. Under rotation for an event in spacetime represented by a quaternion, time is unchanged, but the 3-vector for space would be rotated. The treatment of scalars is the same as above, but the notion of vectors is far more restrictive, as restrictive as the notion of scalars. Quaternions can only handle 3-vectors. To those familiar to playing with higher dimensions, this may appear too restrictive to be of interest. Yet physics on both the quantum and cosmological scales is confined to 3-spatial dimensions. Note that the infinite Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics a function of the principle quantum number n, not the spatial dimensions. An infinite collection of quaternions of the form (En, Pn) could represent a quantum state. The Hilbert space is formed using the Euclidean product (q* q'). A dual quaternion is formed by taking the conjugate, because q* q = (t^2 + X.X, 0). A tangent quaternion is created by having an operator act on a quaternion-valued function What would happen to these five terms if space were shrunk? The 3-vector F would get shrunk, as would the divisors in the Del operator, making functions acted on by Del get larger. The scalar terms are completely unaffected by shrinking space, because df/dt has nothing to shrink, and the Del and F cancel each other. The time derivative of the 3-vector is a contravariant vector, because F would get smaller. The gradient of the scalar field is a covariant vector, because of the work of the Del operator in the divisor makes it larger. The curl at first glance might appear as a draw, but it is a covariant vector capacity because of the right-angle nature of the cross product. Note that if time where to shrink exactly as much as space, nothing in the tangent quaternion would change. A quaternion equation must generate the same collection of tensors on both sides. Consider the product of two events, q and q': Where is the axial vector for the left hand side? It is imbedded in the multiplication operation, honest :-) The axial vector is the one that flips signs if the order is reversed. Terms can continue to get more complicated. In a quaternion triple product, there will be terms of the form (XxX').X\". This is called a pseudo-scalar, because it does not change under a rotation, but it will change signs under a reflection, due to the cross product. You can convince yourself of this by noting that the cross product involves the sine of an angle and the dot product involves the cosine of an angle. Neither of these will change under a rotation, and an even function times an odd function is odd. If the order of quaternion triple product is changed, this scalar will change signs for at each step in the permutation. It has been my experience that any tensor in physics can be expressed using quaternions. Sometimes it takes a bit of effort, but it can be done. Individual parts can be isolated if one chooses. Combinations of conjugation operators which flip the sign of a vector, and symmetric and antisymmetric products can isolate any particular term. Here are all the terms of the example from above The metric for quaternions is imbedded in Hamilton's rule for the field. This looks like a way to generate scalars from vectors, but it is more than that. It also says implicitly that i j = k, j k = i, and i, j, k must have inverses. This is an important observation, because it means that inner and outer tensor products can occur in the same operation. When two quaternions are multiplied together, a new scalar (inner tensor product) and vector (outer tensor product) are formed. How can the metric be generalized for arbitrary transformations? The traditional approach would involve playing with Hamilton's rules for the field. I think that would be a mistake, since that rule involves the fundamental definition of a quaternion. Change the rule of what a quaternion is in one context and it will not be possible to compare it to a quaternion in another context. Instead, consider an arbitrary transformation T which takes q into q' T is also a quaternion, in fact it is equal to q' q^-1. This is guaranteed to work locally, within neighborhoods of q and q'. There is no promise that it will work globally, that one T will work for any q. Under certain circumstances, T will work for any q. The important thing to know is that a transformation T necessarily exists because quaternions are a field. The two most important theories in physics, general relativity and the standard model, involve local transformations (but the technical definition of local transformation is different than the idea presented here because it involves groups). This quaternion definition of a transformation creates an interesting relationship between the Minkowski and Euclidean metrics. In order to change from wrist watch time (the interval in spacetime) to the norm of a Hilbert space does not require any change in the transformation quaternion, only a change in the multiplication step. Therefore a transformation which generates the Schwarzschild interval of general relativity should be easily portable to a Hilbert space, and that might be the start of a quantum theory of gravity.","title":"What Are Quaternions?"},{"location":"doing_physics/#so-what-is-the-difference","text":"I think it is subtle but significant. It goes back to something I learned in a graduate level class on the foundations of calculus. To make calculus rigorous requires that it is defined over a mathematical field. Physicists do this be saying that the scalars, vectors and tensors they work with are defined over the field of real or complex numbers. What are the numbers used by nature? There are events, which consist of the scalar time and the 3-vector of space. There is mass, which is defined by the scalar energy and the 3-vector of momentum. There is the electromagnetic potential, which has a scalar field phi and a 3-vector potential A. To do calculus with only information contained in events requires that a scalar and a 3-vector form a field. According to a theorem by Frobenius on finite dimensional fields, the only fields that fit are isomorphic to the quaternions (isomorphic is a sophisticated notion of equality, whose subtleties are appreciated only by people with a deep understanding of mathematics). To do calculus with a mass or an electromagnetic potential has an identical requirement and an identical solution. This is the logical foundation for doing physics with quaternions. Can physics be done without quaternions? Of course it can! Events can be defined over the field of real numbers, and then the Minkowski metric and the Lorentz group can be deployed to get every result ever confirmed by experiment. Quantum mechanics can be defined using a Hilbert space defined over the field of complex numbers and return with every result measured to date. Doing physics with quaternions is unnecessary, unless physics runs into a compatibility issue. Constraining general relativity and quantum mechanics to work within the same topological algebraic field may be the way to unite these two separately successful areas.","title":"So What Is the Difference?"},{"location":"doing_physics/#quaternion-analysis","text":"Complex numbers are a subfield of quaternions. My hypothesis is that complex analysis should be self-evident within the structure of quaternion analysis. The challenge is to define the derivative in a non-singular way, so that a left derivative always equals a right derivative. If quaternions would only commute... Well, the scalar part of a quaternion does commute. If, in the limit, the differential element converged to a scalar, then it would commute. This idea can be defined precisely. All that is required is that the magnitude of the vector goes to zero faster than the scalar. This might initially appears as an unreasonable constraint. However, there is an important application in physics. Consider a set of quaternions that represent events in spacetime. If the magnitude of the 3-space vector is less than the time scalar, events are separated by a timelike interval. It requires a speed less than the speed of light to connect the events. This is true no matter what coordinate system is chosen.","title":"Quaternion Analysis"},{"location":"doing_physics/#defining-a-quaternion","text":"A quaternion has 4 degrees of freedom, so it needs 4 real-valued variables to be defined: Imagine we want to do a simple binary operation such as subtraction, without having to specify the coordinate system chosen. Subtraction will only work if the coordinate systems are the same, whether it is Cartesian, spherical or otherwise. Let e0, e1, e2, and e3 be the shared, but unspecified, basis. Now we can define the difference between two quaternion q and q' that is independent of the coordinate system used for the measurement. What is unusual about this definition are the factors of a third. They will be necessary later in order to define a holonomic equation later in this section. Hamilton gave each element parity with the others, a very reasonable approach. I have found that it is important to give the scalar and the sum of the 3-vector parity. Without this \"scale\" factor on the 3-vector, change in the scalar is not given its proper weight. If dq is squared, the scalar part of the resulting quaternion forms a metric. What should the connection be between the squares of the basis vectors? The amount of intrinsic curvature should be equal, so that a transformation between two basis 3-vectors does not contain a hidden bump. Should time be treated exactly like space? The Schwarzschild metric of general relativity suggests otherwise. Let e1, e2, and e3 form an independent, dimensionless, orthogonal basis for the 3-vector such that: This unusual relationship between the basis vectors is consistent with Hamilton's choice of 1, i, j, k if e0 2 = 1. For that case, calculate the square of dq: The scalar part is known in physics as the Minkowski interval between two events in flat spacetime. If e0 2 does not equal one, then the metric would apply to a non-flat spacetime. A metric that has been measured experimentally is the Schwarzchild metric of general relativity. Set e0 2 = (1 - 2 GM/c 2 R), and calculate the square of dq: This is the Schwarzchild metric of general relativity. Notice that the 3-vector is unchanged (this may be a defining characteristic). There are very few opportunities for freedom in basic mathematical definitions.

This is natural when thinking about the structure of Minkowski spacetime, where the ratio of the change in time to the change in 3-space defines five separate regions: timelike past, timelike future, lightlike past, lightlike future, and spacelike. There are no continuous Lorentz transformations to link these regions. Each region will require a separate definition of the derivative, and they will each have distinct properties. I will start with the simplest case, and look at a series of examples in detail. Definition: The future timelike derivative: Consider a covariant quaternion function f with a domain of H and a range of H. A future timelike derivative to be defined, the 3-vector must approach zero faster than the positive scalar. If this is not the case, then this definition cannot be used. Implementing these requirements involves two limit processes applied sequentially to a differential quaternion D. First the limit of the three vector is taken as it goes to zero, (D - D * )/2 -> 0. Second, the limit of the scalar is taken, (D + D * )/2 -> +0 (the plus zero indicates that it must be approached with a time greater than zero, in other words, from the future). The net effect of these two limit processes is that D->0. The definition is invariant under a passive transformation of the basis. The 4 real variables a0, a1, a2, a3 can be represented by functions using the conjugates as a basis. Begin with a simple example: The definition gives the expected result. A simple approach to a trickier example: So far, the fancy double limit process has been irrelevant for these identity functions, because the differential element has been eliminated. That changes with the following example, a tricky approach to the same result. Because the 3-vector goes to zero faster than the scalar for the differential element, after the first limit process, the remaining differential is a scalar so it commutes with any quaternion. This is what is required to dance around the e1 and lead to the cancellation. The initial hypothesis was that complex analysis should be a self-evident subset of quaternion analysis. So this quaternion derivative should match up with the complex case, which is: These are the same result up to two subedits. Quaternions have three imaginary axes, which creates the factor of three. The conjugate of a complex number is really doing the work of the first quaternion conjugate q *1 (which equals -z * ), because z * flips the sign of the first 3-vector component, but no others. The derivative of a quaternion applies equally well to polynomials. This is the expected result for this polynomial. It would be straightforward to show that all polynomials gave the expected results. Mathematicians might be concerned by this result, because if the 3-vector D goes to -D nothing will change about the quaternion derivative. This is actually consistent with principles of special relativity. For timelike separated events, right and left depend on the inertial reference frame, so a timelike derivative should not depend on the direction of the 3-vector.","title":"Future Timelike Derivative"},{"location":"doing_physics/#analytic-functions","text":"There are 4 types of quaternion derivatives and 4 component functions. The following table describes the 16 derivatives for this set This table will be used extensively to evaluate if a function is analytic using the chain rule. Let's see if the identity function w = q is analytic. Use the chain rule to calculate the derivative will respect to each term: Use combinations of these terms to calculate the four quaternion derivatives using the chain rule. This has the derivatives expected if w=q is analytic in q. Another test involves the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The presence of the three basis vectors changes things slightly. This also solves a holonomic equation. There are no off diagonal terms to compare. This exercise can be repeated for the other identity functions. One noticeable change is that the role that the conjugate must play. Consider the identity function w = q *1 . To show that this is analytic in q *1 requires that one always works with basis vectors of the q *1 variety. This also solves a first conjugate holonomic equation. Power functions can be analyzed in exactly the same way: This time there are cross terms involved. At first glance, one might think these are incorrect, since the signs of the derivatives are suppose to be opposite. Actually they are, but it is hidden in an accounting trick :-) For example, the derivative of u with respect to a1 has a factor of e1 2 , which makes it negative. The derivative of the first component of V with respect to a0 is positive. Keeping all the information about signs in the e's makes things look non-standard, but they are not. Note that these are three scalar equalities. The other Cauchy-Riemann equations evaluate to a single 3-vector equation. This represents four constraints on the four degrees of freedom found in quaternions to find out if a function happens to be analytic. This also solves a holonomic equation. Since power series can be analytic, this should open the door to all forms of analysis. (I have done the case for the cube of q, and it too is analytic in q).","title":"Analytic Functions"},{"location":"doing_physics/#4-other-derivatives","text":"So far, this work has only involved future timelike derivatives. There are five other regions of spacetime to cover. The simplest next case is for past timelike derivatives. The only change is in the limit, where the scalar approaches zero from below. This will make many derivatives look time symmetric, which is the case for most laws of physics. A more complicated case involves spacelike derivatives. In the spacelike region, changes in time go to zero faster than the absolute value of the 3-vector. Therefore the order of the limit processes is reversed. This time the scalar approaches zero, then the 3-vector. This creates a problem, because after the first limit process, the differential element is (0, D), which will not commute with most quaternions. That will lead to the differential element not cancelling. The way around this is to take its norm, which is a scalar. A spacelike differential element is defined by taking the ratio of a differential quaternion element D to its 3-vector, D - D * . Let the norm of D approach zero. To be defined, the three vector must approach zero faster than its corresponding scalar. To make the definition non-singular everywhere, multiply by the conjugate. In the limit D D * /((D - D * )(D - D * ))* approaches (1, 0), a scalar. To make this concrete, consider a simple example, f = q^2. Apply the definition: The second and fifth terms are unitary rotations of the 3-vector B. Since the differential element D could be pointed anywhere, this is an arbitrary rotation. Define: Substitute, and continue: Look at how wonderfully strange this is! The arbitrary rotation of the 3-vector B means that this derivative is bound by an inequality. If D is in direction of B, then it will be an equality, but D could also be in the opposite direction, leading to a destruction of a contribution from the 3-vector. The spacelike derivative can therefore interfere with itself. This is quite a natural thing to do in quantum mechanics. The spacelike derivative is positive definite, and could be used to define a Banach space. Defining the lightlike derivative, where the change in time is equal to the change in space, will require more study. It may turn out that this derivative is singular everywhere, but it will require some skill to find a technically viable compromise between the spacelike and timelike derivative to synthesis the lightlike derivative.","title":"4 Other Derivatives"},{"location":"doing_physics/#topological-properties-of-quaternions","text":"","title":"Topological Properties of Quaternions"},{"location":"doing_physics/#i-have-not-taken-a-topology-class-so-no-doubt-this-particular-section-contains-errors","text":"Mathematician are so much more precise than I will ever be.","title":"I have not taken a topology class, so no doubt this particular section contains errors."},{"location":"doing_physics/#topological-space","text":"If we choose to work systematically through Wald's \"General Relativity\", the starting point is \"Appendix A, Topological Spaces\". Roughly, topology is the structure of relationships that do not change if a space is distorted. Some of the results of topology are required to make calculus rigorous. In this section, I will work consistently with the set of quaternions, H^1, or just H for short. The difference between the real numbers R and H is that H is not a totally ordered set and multiplication is not commutative. These differences are not important for basic topological properties, so statements and proofs involving H are often identical to those for R. First an open ball of quaternions needs to be defined to set the stage for an open set. Define an open ball in H of radius (r, 0) centered around a point (y, Y) [note: small letters are scalars, capital letters are 3-vectors] consisting of points (x, X) such that An open set in H is any set which can be expressed as a union of open balls. [p. 423 translated] A quaternion topological space (H,T) consists of the set H together with a collection T of subsets of H with these properties: The union of an arbitrary collection of subsets, each in T, is in T The intersection of a finite number of subsets of T is in T The entire set H and the empty set are in T T is the topology on H. The subsets of H in T are open sets. Quaternions form a topology because they are what mathematicians call a metric space, since q * q evaluates to a real positive number or equals zero only if q is zero. Note: this is not the meaning of metric used by physicists. For example, the Minkowski metric can be negative or zero even if a point is not zero. To keep the same word with two meanings distinct, I will refer to one as the topological metric, the other as an interval metric. These descriptive labels are not used in general since context usually determines which one is in play. An important component to standard approaches to general relativity is product spaces. This is how a topology for R n is created. Events in spacetime require R 4 , one place for time, three for space. Mathematicians get to make choices: what would change if work was done in R 2 , R 3 , or R 5 ? The precision of this notion, together with the freedom to make choices, makes exploring these decisions fun (for those few who can understand what is going on :-) By working with H, product spaces are unnecessary. Events in spacetime can be members of an open set in H. Time is the scalar, space the 3-vector. There is no choice to be made.","title":"Topological Space"},{"location":"doing_physics/#open-sets","text":"The edges of sets will be examined by defining boundaries, open and closed sets, and the interior and closure of a set. I am a practical guy who likes pragmatic definitions. Let the real numbers L and U represent arbitrary lower and upper bounds respectively such that L < U. For the quaternion topological space (H, T), consider an arbitrary induced topology (A, t) where x and a are elements of A. Use inequalities to define: The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open. The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open. The union of a finite number of closed sets is closed. The intersection of an arbitrary number of closed sets is closed. Clearly there are connections between the above definitions This creates complementary ideas. [Wald, p.424] The interior of A is the union of all open sets contained within A. The interior equals A if and only if A is open. The closure of A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. The closure of A equals A if and only if A is closed. Define a point set as the set where the lower bound equals the upper bound. The only open set that is a point set is the null set. The closed point set is H. A point set for the real numbers has only one element which is identical to the boundary. A point set for quaternions has an infinite number of elements, one of them identical to the boundary. What are the implications for physics? With quaternions, the existence an open set of events has nothing to do with the causality of that collection of events. A proper time can have exactly the same absolute value as a pure spacelike separation, so these two will be included in the same sets, whether open, closed or on a boundary. There is no correlation the reverse way either. Take for example a collection of lightlike events. Even though they all share exactly the same interval - namely zero - their absolute value can vary all over the map, not staying within limits. Although independent, these two ideas can be combined synergistically. Consider an open set S of timelike intervals. The set S could depict a classical world history since they are causally linked and have good topological properties. A closed set of lightlike events could be a focus of quantum electrodynamics. Topology plus causality could be the key for subdividing different regions of physics. Hausdorff Topology This property is used to analyze compactness, something vital for rigorously establishing differentiation and integration. [Wald p424] The quaternion topological space (H, T) is Hausdorff because for each pair of distinct points a, b E H, a not equal to b, one can find open sets Oa, Ob E T such that a E Oa, b I Ob and the intersection of Oa and Ob is the null set. For example, find the half-way point between a and b. Let that be the radius of an open ball around the points a and b: Neither set quite reaches the other, so their intersection is null.","title":"Open Sets"},{"location":"doing_physics/#compact-sets","text":"In this section, I will begin an investigation of compact sets of quaternions. I hope to share some of my insights into this subtle but significant topic. First we need the definition of a compact set of quaternions. [Translation of Wald p. 424] Let A be a subset of the quaternions H. Set A could be opened, closed or neither. An open cover of A is the union of open sets {Oa} that contains A. A union of open sets is open and could have an infinite number of members. A subset of {Oa} that still covers A is called a subcover. If the subcover has a finite number of elements it is called a finite subcover. The set A subset of H is compact if every open cover of A has a finite subcover. Let's find an example of a compact set of quaternions. Consider a set S composed of points with a finite number of absolute values: The set S has an infinite number of members, since for any of the equalities, specifying the absolute value still leaves three degrees of freedom (if the domain had been x E R, then S would have had a finite number of elements). The set S can be covered by an open set {O} which could have an infinite number of members. There exists a subset {C} of {O} that is finite and still covers S. The subset {C} would have one member for each absolute value. Every set of quaternions composed of a finite number of absolute values like the set S is compact. Notice that the set S is closed because it consists of a boundary without an interior. The link between compact, closed and bound set is important, and will be examined next A compact set is a statement about the ability to find a finite number of open sets that cover a set, given any open cover. A closed set is the interior of a set plus the boundary of that set. A set is bound if there exists a real number M such that the distance between a point and any member of the set is less than M. For quaternions with the standard topology, in order to have a finite number of open sets that cover the set, the set must necessarily include its boundary and be bound. In other words, to be compact is to be closed and bound, to be closed and bound is to be compact. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 1 (Heine-Borel). A closed interval of quaternions S: with the standard topology on H is compact. Wald does not provide a proof since it appears in many books on analysis. Invariably the Heine-Borel Theorem employs the domain of the real numbers, x E R. However, nothing in that proof changes by using quaternions as the domain. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 2. Let the topology (H, T) be Hausdorff and let the set A subset of H be compact. Then A is closed. Theorem 3. Let the topology (H, T) be compact and let the set A subset of H be closed. Then A is compact. Combine these theorems to create a stronger statement on the compactness of subsets of quaternions H. Theorem 4. A subset A of quaternions is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The property of compactness is easily proved to be preserved under continuous maps. Theorem 5. Let (H, T) and (H', T') be topological spaces. Suppose (H, T) is compact and the function f: H -> H' is continuous. The f[H] = {h' E H' | h' = f(h)} is compact. This creates a corollary by theorem 4. Theorem 6. A continuous function from a compact topological space into H is bound and its absolute value attains a maximum and minimum values.

In particular, the product space R 4 should have the same topology as the quaternions. Hopefully, subtlety matters in the discussion of the logical foundations of general relativity. Both R 1 and H 1 have a rule for multiplication, but H 1 has an antisymmetric component. This is a description of a difference.

What then has to be different is the interval. But how different, and how does that depend on the gravitional source mass? Fortunately, there is no choice in answering the question if one is to be consistent with current experimental tests of gravity. For a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged source, gravity depends on the ratio of the graviational source mass over the distance to the center of that mass. Whatever function is used to make the time measurement smaller must be the exact inverse of the one that makes a spatial measurment larger. Since gravitational systems follow simple harmonic patterns for billions of years, an exponential and its inverse that depens on the M/R ratio is an obvious thing to propose. The interval looks just like the Rosen bi-metric proposal, even though quaternion gravity uses no metrics. The Rosen metric is known to be consistent with current tests of weak field gravity up to first-order Parametrized Post-Newtonian accuracy. The extra metric creates a problem for Rosen's proposal since gravity waves would have a dipole moment and lose entry faster than observed. The simplicity of the quaternion gravity proposal would require for an isolated mass in space that the lowest mode of emission is a quadrapole, consistent with what is seen. Yet there is no graviton with quaternion gravity. The energy could be carried away with photons that happen to have a quadrapole moment, but no a dipole one.

B. Sweetser March 31, 2015 *Essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2015 Awards for Essays on Gravitation 39 Drummer Road, Acton, MA 01720 sweetser@alum.mit.edu Abstract The square of a quaternion luckily has the Lorentz invariant interval of special relativity as its first term. The other three space-times-time terms are commonly ignored. Ways to vary a quaternion with a continuous function that leave the intraval in the square invariant are discussed. One method uses exponentials, leading to the hyperbolic functions found useful in special relativity. Using the same approach to keep the space-times-time invariantleads to a dynamic interval term. By preserving the space-times-time terms using an exponential function and the geometric source mass, an interval term is found that is similar but experimentally distinct from the Schwarzschild metric applied to space-time 4-vectors. Space-times-time invariance is not a field theory, so gravitons are not necessary and quantization is moot. General relativity, Einstein's elegant theory of gravity, is a field theory like the three other fundamental forces of Nature: electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force. The cause of gravity is any form of energy or momentum. The field equations dictate the motion of particles with energy, thus applying to all particles, even light. Special relativity is not a special case of general relativity, despite the name. Special relativity is about an invariant quantity in Nature that all inertial observers agree upon: the interval, a difference of squares in measurements of space and time. Special relativity applies to all measurements, even those involving the fundamental forces. The product of a measurement in space and one in time, referred to hereafter as space-times- time, will change in known ways for different inertial observers. 1 This essay explores the opposite situation: what if two observers find their space-times-time was an invariant, but their intervals were different? It is suggestive that a defining characteristic of general relativity is that intervals vary at different places in a gravitational field. The invariant interval of special relativity in flat spacetime is generated by contracting a 4-vector using the Minkowski metric. With such a simple system, other products are omitted, namely, any with the space-times-time form, dtdxi. Such terms could appear if one used a metric with non-diagonal components which are unnecessary for flat spacetime. There is a type of math that naturally embraces space-times-time terms. All are familiar with real numbers, a mathematical field that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The complex numbers are also a mathematical field, but now one has two degrees of freedom, often represented by a pair of numbers. 2 Complex numbers are no longer a totally ordered set. The next sort of numbers has four-part harmonies, with a real bass and three imaginary tenors. Known as the quaternions, they do not commute, so live with the label of a division algebra. Quaternions still retain addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The rules are similar for the complex numbers, with the imaginary i replaced by an imaginary 3-vector and the inclusion of the anti-symmetric cross product. Quaternions play a minor technical role as the best way to do rotations in three dimensions.[8] A unit quaternion SU(2) sits in the center of the standard model gauge symmetries. Despite that central role, quaternions have historically been vilified to a comic degree. \"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way, including Maxwell.\" Lord Kelvin[10, See vol. II, p. 1070.] There are published claims that one cannot write the Maxwell equations or represent the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions.[2, 4, 6, 9] Neither happens to be true. See the appendix for details if interested. The square of a space-time measurement represented with quaternions is: The first term of the square is the Lorentz invariant interval. It is followed by the three space-times-time terms. There are a few advantages to having these three extra bits of information. Say two inertial observers Alice and Bob saw a collection of events. The first term of the square of the quaternion would be the same. An analysis of the space-times-time value would let us know how Alice was moving relative to Bob. If they also calculate the product of two different events in both orders, then we would know something about the angle between the events and the observer. If ab = ba, then they are in a straight line. If for the three space-times-time terms, ab = -ba , they are at a right angle. Anything between those extremes is in between. What happens in curved space-time? With the standard machinery of differential geometry, a simple subtraction is not allowed. Instead, one has to parallel transport one event to another along a geodesic using a known connection. Then the subtraction can be done properly. Quaternions don't have a metric. Without a metric, there is no connection. Maybe quaternions are an \"unmixed evil.\" Let's explore anyway. Construct a quaternion out of space-time functions that can be varied, yet the first term of the square is invariant as required by special relativity: If the function f was exactly the same as each normalized gi, then the first term in the square, the interval, would always be zero. 3 This is an important case: it is light. Changes in time are exactly equal to the magnitude of changes in space. With zero covered, find a way so the first term in the square is equal to one for all inertial observers. The square of f must cancel out the square of g, but leave unity behind. Work with a third function h and its inverse: So long as the function h has an inverse, this will always work. 4 Exponential functions play an important role in theoretical physics. If the exponent is zero, unity is the result and nothing is changed. For tiny exponents, the result may contain a simple harmonic oscillator which are ubiquitous in Nature. For the case in hand, the function f is a hyperbolic cosine which is the stretch factor gamma of special relativity. The function g is the hyperbolic sine, the gamma beta factor that also appears in special relativity. Repeat these two simple math exercises for space-times-time. Find a general way to make the square of a measurement have either three zeroes or three ones - times the factor of two that is from the sum of two identical terms. Generating three zero space-times-time factors is easy: take the norm of any quaternion. Some effort has gone into quantum mechanics that uses quaternions in place of complex numbers.[1] That topic is beyond the scope of this short essay. The general way to generate three factors of two is also not difficult: An exponential function could be plugged in as before. This moves from a pure math exercise to one with physics content if the exponential is chosen to be related to gravity by using the geometric length of a mass 5 : Let's pause to discuss this expression. No metric was used to get here. No field equation was solved. Instead a new invariance of Nature has been proposed as it applies to products of quaternions in a weak gravitational system characterized by one length. Algebraically, the first term is the same as the Rosen exponential metric applied to an event 4-vector.[7] Experimental tests of weak gravity fields use the first three terms of the Taylor series expansion in z for the change in time, and the first two for changes in space. Those terms are identical for the space-times-time invariant expression and the Schwarzschild metric in Cartesian coordinates. There is no way to distinguish these two at what is called first-order Parameterized Post- Newtonian (PPN) accuracy. At second order, the new invariance proposal predicts 6% more bending of light around a gravitational source.[3] Since the effect is smaller than a micro-arcsecond, that is beyond our reach today. Massless light is bent by gravity. That can be accounted for in general relativity because the coupling is to energy density which light has. With the space-times-time invariance, there is no coupling term nor any field equations. The same thing happens in special relativity: there is no coupling, nor field equations. The space-times-time invariance may be the correct variation on the invariant interval of special relativity, thus being the simplest pure geometry approach to gravity, but not too simple. With no graviton to quantize, there is no issue of quantizing a gravitational field. What about energy loss by a binary pulsar? The Rosen metric allows for a dipole mode of gravity wave emission, so is ruled out by the data which requires a lower rate of gravity wave emissions.[11, See section 12.3(b).] In the space-times-time invariant proposal, the exponential function and its inverse applied to gravity above was static. Make it dynamic by including a time factor in a way consistent with how we see the metric change in time for a binary pulsar. Is a graviton required to carry away the energy? The system in question is an isolated binary pulsar that conserves both energy and momentum. It does not have a dipole moment like a magnet, but does have a quadruple moment, like a wobbling water balloon. The energy could be carried away by an electromagnetic field that had a quadruple as its lowest moment. While unusual, it is possible. Does gravity as a space-times-time invariance play nicely with the three other fundamental forces of physics? Given the stellar record of special relativity, there is reason to hope.","title":"Quaternion Space-times-time Invariance as Gravity*"},{"location":"doing_physics/#appendix-maxwell-equations-and-the-lorentz-group-using-real-valued","text":"quaternions The homogeneous Maxwell equations are vector identities. They hold when written using quaternions. The Lagrange density used to derive the Maxwell source equations is the difference of the squared magnetic and electric fields[5]: The difference of two squares is the product of their sums and difference. The simplest product of a quaternion differential operator and potential generates the difference of the magnetic and electric fields: This also has a gauge field g which can easily be eliminated by subtracting the conjugate of this product. The sum of these two fields - times a factor of minus one - is formed by reversing the order of the differential with the potential: The first term drops into the Euler-Lagrange equations to generate the Gauss and Ampere laws of electromagnetism. As a bonus, there is the Poynting vector, the directional energy flux density of an electromagnetic field. Representing the compact Lie group needed to do spatial rotations is itself compact when using quaternions: If one tries to simply change from the cosine and sine function to the hyperbolic cosine and sine function, a member of the Lorentz group is not generated. This should not be a surprise since that group is not compact, a non-trivial change. Other terms are required to pull off the trick: Quaternions provide another way to write these expressions. Nothing new is learned, other than to be skeptical of claims about the limitations of quaternions.","title":"Appendix: Maxwell equations and the Lorentz group using real-valued"},{"location":"doing_physics/#bibliography","text":"[1] S.

This cannot be the entire story since we can figure out the the absolute sizes of things. He writes that something about quantum gravity is going to break conformal symmetry.

An invariant is something all observers can agree on. The Egyptions fiture out one long ago: This was the basis for surveying in the flood plains of the Nile. It remains true today. The 3D Egyptions know we could also include a third spacial dimension: Einstein showed that Egyptions in rockets could only agree on the inverval between events. Accelerating or spinning is alright for observing events is you can figure out the right sort of functions to put into the interval. Masters of general relativity can figure out the dynamic functions for f and g in only a few special cases because the math remains so difficult. The proposal described in this site, quaternion gravity, should make this issue tractable since then one has an algebra problem instead of ten nonliner differential equations to solve. For the rest of the discussion of EM, it is assumed f and g are equal to one since it makes the math simple. The first term of a quaternion product is a Lorentz invariant scalar. Couple the current with the potential by multiplying them together: The electric and magentic fields can be written in terms of differential operators acting on a potential. Form the product: The first term is a gauge term. EM has gauge symmetry. Set this to zero in a way that assures that no matter what gauge we pick - terms involving the time derivative of phi or divergence of A - the other terms are unchanged.

If the signs are different (a t and a -t for example), then the cross terms will cancel on the left hand side of the inequality, making it smaller than the right hand side where terms never cancel because there are only squared terms. The Schwarz inequality in quantum mechanics is analogous to dot products and cosines in Euclidean space. Let a third wave function, chi, be the sum of these two with an arbitrary parameter lambda. The norm of chi will necessarily be greater than zero. Choose the value for lambda that helps combine all the terms containing lambda. Multiply through by the denominator, separate the two resulting terms and do some minor rearranging. This is now the Schwarz inequality. Another inequality: Examine the square of the norm of the difference between two quaternions which is necessarily equal to or greater than zero. The cross terms can be put on the other side of inequality, changing the sign, and leaving the sum of two norms behind. The inequality holds. The parallelogram law: Test the quaternion norm This is twice the square of the norms of the two separate components.","title":"Identities and Inequalities"},{"location":"doing_physics/#implications_4","text":"In the case for special relativity, it was noticed that by simply squaring a quaternion, the resulting first term was the Lorentz invariant interval. From that solitary observation, the power of a mathematical field was harnessed to solve a wide range of problems in special relativity. In a similar fashion, it is hoped that because the product of a transpose of a quaternion with a quaternion has the properties of a complete inner product space, the power of the mathematical field of quaternions can be used to solve a wide range of problems in quantum mechanics. This is an important area for further research. Note: this goal is different from the one Stephen Adler sets out in \"Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.\" He tries to substitute quaternions in the place of complex numbers in the standard Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. The analytical properties of quaternions do not play a critical role. It is the properties of the Hilbert space over the field of quaternions that is harnessed to solve problems. It is my opinion that since the product of a transpose of a quaternion with a quaternion already has the properties of a norm in a Hilbert space, there is no need to imbed quaternions again within another Hilbert space.

The angle is the arccosine of the ratio of the first component of a quaternion over the norm. The vector component is generated by normalizing the pure quaternion (the final three terms) to the norm of the pure quaternion. I 2 equals -1 just like i 2. Let (0, V) = (q - q*)/2.

Given a Lie algebra of a Lie group in a sufficiently small area the identity, the product of two exponentials can be defined using the Campbell-Hausdorff formula: This formula is not easy to use, and is only applicable in a small area around unity. Quaternion analysis that relies on this formula would be very limited. I have developed (perhaps for the first time) a simpler and general way to express the product of two quaternion exponentials as the sum of two components. The product of two quaternions splits into a commuting and an anti-commuting part. The rules for multiplying commuting quaternions are identical to those for complex numbers. The anticommuting part needs to be purely imaginary. The Grassman product (q q') of two quaternion exponentials and the Euclidean product (q* q') should both have these properties. Together these define the needs for the product of two quaternion exponentials. I call these operators \"conjugators\" because they involve taking the conjugate of the two elements. Andrew Millard made the suggestion for the Grassman product that unifies these approaches nicely. What is happening here is that both commuting and anticommuting parts scale themselves appropriately. By using an exponential that has pi/2 multiplied by a normalized quaternion, this always has a zero scalar, as it must to accurately represent an anticommuting part.","title":"New method for multiplying quaternion exponentials"},{"location":"doing_physics/#commutators-and-the-uncertainty-principle","text":"Commutators and the uncertainty principle are central to quantum mechanics.

This is identical to Euler's formula except that the imaginary unit vector i is replaced by the normalized 3-vector. The two are equivalent if j = k = 0. Any quaternion could be the limit of the sum of an infinite number of other quaternions expressed in a polar form. I hope to show that such a quaternion mathematically behaves like the wave function of quantum mechanics, even if the notation is different. To simplify things, use a normalized quaternion, so that q q = 1. Collect the normalized 3-vector together with I = V/(V V)^.5. The angle s/(q* q)^.5 is a real number. Any real number can be viewed as the product of two other real numbers. This seemingly irrelevant observation lends much of the flexibility seen in quantum mechanics :-) Here is the rewrite of q. The unit vector I could also be viewed as the product of two quaternions.For classical quantum mechanics, this additional complication is unnecessary. It may be required for relativistic quantum mechanics, so this should be kept in mind. A point of clarification on notation:the same letter will be used 4 distinct ways.There are operators, A hat, which act on a quaternion wave function by multiplying by a quaternion, capital A. If the operator A hat is an observable, then it generates a real number, (a, 0), which commutes with all quaternions, whatever their form. There is also a variable with respect to a component of a quaternion, a_i, that can be used to form a differential operator. Define a linear operator A hat that multiplies q by the quaternion A. If the operator A hat is an observable, then the quaternion A is a real number, (a, 0). This will commute with any quaternion. This equation is functionally equivalent to an eigenvalue equation, with A hat as an eigenvector of q and (a, 0) as the eigenvalue. However, all of the components of this equation are quaternions, not separate structures such as an operator belonging to a group and a vector. This might make a subtle but significant difference for the mathematical structure of the theory, a point that will not be investigated here. Define a linear operator B hat that multiplies q by the quaternion B. If B hat is an observable, then this operator can be defined in terms of the scalar variable a. Operators A and B are linear. Calculate the commutator [A, B], which involves the scalar a and the derivative with respect to a. The commutator acting on a quaternion is equivalent to multiplying that quaternion by the normalized 3-vector I.","title":"Commutators"},{"location":"doing_physics/#the-uncertainty-principle","text":"Use these operators to construct things that behave like averages (expectation values) and standard deviations.

Define a new operator A' based on A whose expectation value is always zero. Define the square of the operator in a way designed to link up with the standard deviation. An identical set of tools can be defined for B. In the section on bracket notation, the Schwarz inequality for quaternions was shown. The Schwarz inequality applies to quaternions, not quaternion operators. If the operators A' and B' are surrounded on both sides by q and q*, then they will behave like scalars. The left-hand side of the Schwarz inequality can be rearranged to form a commutator. The right-hand side of the Schwarz inequality can be rearranged to form the square of the standard deviation operators.

This perspective should be easy to generalize. Second, the uncertainty principle and gravity are related to the same mathematical properties. This proof of the uncertainty relation involved the Schwarz inequality. It is fairly straightforward to convert that inequality to the triangle inequality.

What happens with the scalar is irrelevant to this dimensional counting. The same rotation matrix acting on the same quaternion behaves differently depending directly on what involutions are involved. Quaternions have 4 degrees of freedom. If we want to represent quaternions with automorphisms, 4 are required: They are the identity automorphism, the conjugate anti-automorphism, the first conjugate anti-automorphism, and the second conjugate anti-automorphism: where e1, e2, e3 are orthogonal basis vectors The most important automorphism is the identity. Life is stable around small permutations of the identity:-) The conjugate flips the signs of the each component in the 3-vector. These two automorphisms, the identity and the conjugate, treat the 3-vector as a unit. The first and second conjugate flip the signs of all terms but the first and second terms, respectively. Therefore these operators act on only the two of the three components in the 3-vector. By acting on only two of three components, a commutator will behave differently.

Define: Two technical points. First, Sakurai considered rotations around any point along the z axis. This analysis is confined to the z axis at the origin, a significant but not unreasonable constraint. Second, these rotations are written with generalized coordinates instead of the very familiar and comfortable x, y, z. This extra effort will be useful when considering how rotations are effected by curved spacetime.

Repeat this exercise one last time for the first conjugate: This points exactly the opposite way,even for an infinitesimal angle! This is the kernel required to form a unified representation of integral and half integral spin. Imagine adding up a series of these small rotations, say 2 pi of these. No doubt the identity and conjugates will bring you back exactly where you started. The first and second conjugates in the commutator will point in the opposite direction.

For the first conjugate, the first term will have the correct sign after a 2 pi journey, but the scalar, third and forth terms will point the opposite way. A similar, but not identical story applies for the second conjugate. With the identity, we can see exactly what happens if q changes places with q' with a commutator. Notice, I stopped right at the commutator (not including any additional conjugator). In that case: Under an exchange, the identity and conjugate commutators form a distinct group from the commutators formed with the first and second conjugates. The behavior in a commutator under exchange of the identity automorphism and the anti-automorphic conjugate are identical. The first and second conjugates are similar, but not identical.

Define a dimensionless quaternion psi that is this product over h bar. The scalar part of psi is also seen in plane wave solutions of quantum mechanics. The complicated 3-vector is a new animal, but notice it is composed of all the parts seen in the scalar, just different permutations that evaluate to 3-vectors. One might argue that for completeness, all combinations of E, t, R and P should be involved in psi, as is the case here. Any quaternion can be expressed in polar form: Express psi in polar form. To make things simpler, assume that psi is normalized, so |psi| = 1. The 3-vector of psi is quite complicated, so define one symbol to capture it: Now rewrite psi in polar form with these simplifications: This is what I call the quaternion wave function.

As was shown in the section on bracket notation, the Euclidean product of psi (psi* psi) will have all the properties required to form a Hilbert space.

Energy and Momentum are conserved. Energy is evenly distributed in space 3. The system is isolated 4. The position 3-vector X is in the same direction as the momentum 3-vector P The implications of this last assumption are not obvious but can be computed directly by taking the appropriate derivative. Here is a verbal explanation. If energy and momentum are conserved, they will not change in time. If the position 3-vector which does change is always in the same direction as the momentum 3-vector, then I will remain constant in time. Since I is in the direction of X, its curl will be zero. This last constraint may initially appear too confining. Contrast this with the typical classical quantum mechanics. In that case, there is an imaginary factor i which contains no information about the system. It is a mathematical tool tossed in so that the equation has the correct properties. With quaternions, I is determined directly from E, t, P and X. It must be richer in information content. This particular constraint is a reflection of that. Now take the time derivative of psi. The denominator must be at least 1, and can be greater that that. It can serve as a damper, a good thing to tame runaway terms. Unfortunately, it also makes solving explicitly for energy impossible unless Et - P.X equals zero. Since the goal is to make a direct connection to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, make one final assumption: There are several important cases when this will be true. In a vacuum, E and P are zero. If this is used to study photons, then t = |R| and E = |P|. If this number happens to be constant in time, then this equation will apply to the wave front. Now with these 5 assumptions in hand, energy can be defined with an operator. The equivalence of the energy E and this operator is called the first quantization. Take the spatial derivative of psi using the under the same assumptions: Square this operator. The Hamiltonian equals the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. Typographically, this looks very similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Capital I is a normalized 3-vector, and a very complicated one at that if you review the assumptions that got us here. phi is not a vector, but is a quaternion. This give the equation more, not less, analytical power. With all of the constraints in place, I expect that this equation will behave exactly like the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

It would be great to include gravity, which is all about how measurements change as one moves around a differentiable 4D manifold. Include the metric as part of the calculation of a quaternion product. The group Diff(M) is all diffeomorphisms of a compact smooth manifold. It is at the heart of general relativity. One can imagine this spacetime filling sphere on any compact smooth manifold. What happens if q=q'? That is shown below: What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is The standard model is about the group symmetry of the quaternion multiplication identity in spacetime. OK, but what does that mean? Here is my take. Observers sit at here-now in spacetime, or numerically at (0, 0, 0, 0). An observer sees something out there, and tries to characterize the \"thingie\". The basic bit of information it can classify is an event. Whatever set of events is collected, they are all tied up in describing this one thingie out there. Every event contributes to the description of the thingie, and so makes a group. The multiplicative identity of a quaternion, (1, 0, 0, 0) is a way to represent the thingie. Almost none of the events map to (1, 0, 0, 0). The events are scattered all around spacetime. U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) is the way to cow-rope all the events and bring them home, while remaining part of the same group, the one thing being observed.","title":"U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) - The Standard Model"},{"location":"doing_physics/#time-reversal-transformations-for-intervals","text":"Classical Time Reversal Relativistic Time Reversal Implications The following transformation R for quaternions reverses time: The quaternion R exist because quaternions are a field.

Yet classically, time reversal appears to involve entropy, and relativistically, time reversal involves antiparticles. In this notebook, a time reversal quaternion has been derived and shown to work. Time reversal for classical and relativistic intervals have distinct limits, but these transformations have not yet been tied explicitly to the laws of physics.","title":"Implications"},{"location":"doing_physics/#buttons","text":"| | | | | -- | -- | -- | | | | | Promote the Doing Physics with Quaternions Project, and look cool :-) These 5 buttons represent a visual presentation of some of the key ideas behind my efforts to unify gravity and electromagnetism. Fine cuisine depends on starting with the best ingredients. Great physics depends on using new powerful math. An event in space-time has one dimension for time and three dimensions for space, the most powerful tool would be a generalized number that can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided, but has four parts to it. There is one such number called a quaternion, shown here. Time is t, and x, y, and z are the values the event may have in the three directions, i, j, and k. Quaternions are the mathematical foundation for all my efforts in theoretical physics. A person standing on a scale in a closed box could not tell the difference between the box sitting on the surface of the Earth or the box accelerating at the same rate as the Earth's gravity in a rocket ship as depicted here. Einstein called this the equivalence principle, but it only applied to mass, not charge. The General Equivalence Principle extends this idea of fooling observers to cover any measurement. The box mathematically means \"all the changes in time and space.\" One can ask, what are all the possible changes in the direction rulers (I) and the potential (A), or Box IA? The usual answer is the rulers are fixed and it is the potential that changes, I Box A. However, the answer could also be the potential is the same, but the rulers are changing, A Box I. A unified field theory describes light and gravity in the same equation. Einstein spent the last half of his life looking for one, but did not succeed. The equation on the right reads in mathlish, \"The change in the change in the potential equals some constants times the source.\" The stars are involved in games with plus and minus signs. It takes work to see that the signs are correct. A unified field theory must be able to describe all forms of change. The graphic tries to depict this: changes in a square grid, changes moving straight out from the center, changes that are circular ripples, and changes that are spirals. The graphic does not show changes in time or the third dimension. It is only a graphic after all. The standard model is used to quantify why there are this many of that kind of subatomic particle, and that many of those particles. A vast amount of exquisite detail is explained. No one has justified why the standard model should be this way. The standard model is constructed from what are called symmetry groups which go by the names U(1), SU(2), and SU(3). The quaternion unified field theory can be written in a way that lines up perfectly with two of these symmetries. The connection to the SU(3) symmetry is unclear now, although technically it has the right number of fingers and toes (eight in this case). Newton's law of gravity works to explain the rotation of the Moon around the Earth. Newton's law of gravity works to explain the velocity of stars near the center of a galaxy, but fails to explain why stars further from the center maintain that same velocity. One hypothesis is called dark matter, stuff that cannot be seen but makes the velocities work out just so. All physics laws must respect relativity and the rules of calculus. These rules create the second term which has a constant velocity and accurately describes the distribution of mass with respect to the radius, no dark matter required.","title":"Buttons"},{"location":"doing_physics/#pdfs-for-further-reading","text":"","title":"PDFs for further reading"},{"location":"doing_physics/#this-site","text":"The entire site is available a number of ways.

I was aware I was babbling - saying words that are part of the lexicon of physics, but would not make sense to an actual physicist. I decide to keep a day job, but work study physics in the background. Boston was the perfect city in the 1990s to study physics on the side. I took a Harvard Extension class on Special Relativity taught by Edwin F. Taylor as he was writing the book \"Spacetime Physics\" with Johnathon Wheeler. Taylor would bring in a new chapter from Copy Copy, and we were assigned to critique it. Thus became my respectful skeptical analysis of physics. I decide to keep a day job, but work study physics in the background. I was able to show some of my earliest efforts to a famous physicist who worked at MIT.

In one math book, I recalled some odd sort of number that was like a scalar and a vector. The contest motivated me to reread that passage, then go to an old-fashion library and read up about quaternions. This was the first equation I saw, the squaring of a quaternion: To this day, this makes me excited because the first term is at the core of special relativity as taught to me by Edwin F. Taylor.

One lesson from general relativity is that a theory of gravity must be a metric theory - a theory where the calculation of distance depends on where one happens to be in a gravitational field. Measuring distance is a symmetric operation, meaning there is no handed to doing the work. Quaternions do have a handedness. There is no way around that. So I reinvented hypercomplex numbers. Those have all the same multiplication rules as quaternions, but no minus signs anywhere. As such, hypercomplex numbers could be used to characterize a metric. I confess to having pride in the proposal, enough to print up t-shirts. It was difficult to find a professional to review the body of work. I began blogging on Science20.com. There I found a few technically skilled readers. When I finally got to presenting what I called the GEM proposal, several readers objected to the work. It took a little over a month for me to really see the proposal like they did. The flaw was deadly. A Lagrangian constructed from quaternions will not change under a rotation. It will therefore conserve angular momentum. A Lagrangian constructed from hypercomplex numbers will change under a rotation. It will not conserve angular momentum. Kepler's law of equal area in equal time is a statement that gravity conserves angular momentum. Thus a proposal for gravity using hypercomplex number in the Lagrangian is wrong.

Brandeis, 2000-2002 MS: Computer Software Engineering Work Experience Biology My first job was as a lab tech at the newly opened Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. On the first week on the job, Prof. Rick Young showed me how to clone the first genes ever from the Mycobacteria that causes leprosy. The work was featured on a NOVA documentary. Twelve technical papers were written in a three year paper in the most important journals in biology, including Nature, Cell, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Worked as a lab tech for Jac Nickoloff at the Harvard School of Public Health (8 years). My heart was elsewhere (which caused problems on the job). Computers The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) was started in Brookline, MA in 1989. They were my first ISP. After leaving the biology business, I worked the phones in a support role. I also helped maintain the billing software written in Perl. The shifting landscape of ISPs lead then to downsize in 2003. I was the 9th employee of Black Duck Software. They initially wanted to help companies understand the licensing requirements behind open source software. I was hired as a \"spider\", crawling the Internet and harvesting open source software for our knowledgebase. Physics Initial interest In the Christmas of 1988, both my mother and sister independently bought the book: \"A Brief History of Time\" by Stephen Hawking. I view that as my \"born again\" moment, one based on physics, not the Bible. For a month long period, my mind kept rearranging information, sure that everything somehow made sense. I was aware I was babbling - saying words that are part of the lexicon of physics, but would not make sense to an actual physicist. I decide to keep a day job, but work study physics in the background. Boston was the perfect city in the 1990s to study physics on the side. I took a Harvard Extension class on Special Relativity taught by Edwin F. Taylor as he was writing the book \"Spacetime Physics\" with Johnathon Wheeler. Taylor would bring in a new chapter from Copy Copy, and we were assigned to critique it. Thus became my respectful skeptical analysis of physics. I decide to keep a day job, but work study physics in the background. I was able to show some of my earliest efforts to a famous physicist who worked at MIT. He said it was \"interesting, but not very interesting\". The reason was I did not have a theory, a means to make many calculations. At the time, all I had were a few math widgets. First work on quaternions In the struggle to find a theory, I held a small contest on a moderated newsgroup, sci.physics.research in 1997. I asked readers to provide a brief definition of time. It had to be about math or physics, not philosophy, and needed to be two sentences or less. In one math book, I recalled some odd sort of number that was like a scalar and a vector. The contest motivated me to reread that passage, then go to an old-fashion library and read up about quaternions. This was the first equation I saw, the squaring of a quaternion: To this day, this makes me excited because the first term is at the core of special relativity as taught to me by Edwin F. Taylor. It is there, for free. That cannot be an accident. That observation drove me to purchase the domain quaternions.com. Major failure at a unified field theory I struggled to come up with a way to deal with gravity using only quaternions. One lesson from general relativity is that a theory of gravity must be a metric theory - a theory where the calculation of distance depends on where one happens to be in a gravitational field. Measuring distance is a symmetric operation, meaning there is no handed to doing the work. Quaternions do have a handedness. There is no way around that. So I reinvented hypercomplex numbers. Those have all the same multiplication rules as quaternions, but no minus signs anywhere. As such, hypercomplex numbers could be used to characterize a metric. I confess to having pride in the proposal, enough to print up t-shirts. It was difficult to find a professional to review the body of work. I began blogging on Science20.com. There I found a few technically skilled readers. When I finally got to presenting what I called the GEM proposal, several readers objected to the work. It took a little over a month for me to really see the proposal like they did. The flaw was deadly. A Lagrangian constructed from quaternions will not change under a rotation. It will therefore conserve angular momentum. A Lagrangian constructed from hypercomplex numbers will change under a rotation. It will not conserve angular momentum. Kepler's law of equal area in equal time is a statement that gravity conserves angular momentum. Thus a proposal for gravity using hypercomplex number in the Lagrangian is wrong. End of story. Current research Web sites: Quaternions.com , the mothership of my private research project. Numbers 101 , a visual introduction to space-time numbers, aka quaternions. Measurement 101 , a site dedicated to my new proposal for quaternion gravity VisualPhysics.org has a collection of analytic animations generated with a user-hostile set of tools I wrote. Quaternion space-times-time invariance as gravity I went back to the equation that sparked my initial interest in quaternions: The first term is called the interval. But what are the next three called? Physics doesn't have a name. That is a problem because the first term is one of the most important in physics because it is at the heart of special relativity. I came up with a reasonable name for the three amigos: space-times-time. I asked a simple question: what if space-times-time was invariant, then what sort of physics results? That could be gravity, but a very different theory because it is not a field theory. There would be no graviton, nor any quantum gravity theory. The idea had enough promise that I submitted an 1500 word paper to the 2015 Gravitation Research Foundation Essay on Gravity.

He received two S.B. degrees from MIT, in biology and chemical engineering, and has a Masters in Software Engineering at Brandeis. He has extensively exploited art and science educational opportunities available in Boston to pursue his visions. As a result, Doug is developing mathematics powerful enough to go head-to-head with Einstein, backed up by software that can be seen on the web, has a first-rate art collection, and he cruises through Boston in a bicycle of his own design. Education Masters Degree in Software Engineering, Brandeis University Spring 2001 2 S.B. degrees in Biology and Chemical Engineering, MIT June 1984 Software developer Computer Skills Computer languages: Python, Perl, and C Operating systems: Macintosh, Linux Lead Spider, Black Duck Software, Burlington, MA 2004-present The 9th employee of a startup that has grown into an emerging international company. Have been involved in constructing the knowledgebase of all open source projects. Work involves a mix of adding projects using in-house tools, looking to automate processes, and working on the quality of the Postgres database. Responsible for monthly releases of two product lines. Assistant Manager, Customer Accounts, Software Tool & Die, 1998-2002 The oldest Internet service provider (ISP) on the planet is located in Brookline, MA. Doug helped trouble-shoot a range of problems on PCs and Macs. He wrote Perl scripts for the billing department, often on his own initiative. Internet Projects Doing Physics with Quaternions Constructed all aspects of web site devoted to a new approach to physics. Developed mathematics to manipulate 3D space and time consistent with known laws of physics. Promoted interest in site, with over 3000 visits in a year from every continent. YouTube Videos Have produced more than 50 videos with over 350,000 views. Provides the main channel for the \"Stand-Up Physicist\" educational project. These 20+ minute shows have aired on two local Massachusetts cable channels (Acton and Auburn), but have reach far more people than the page devoted to the shows . Command Line Quaternions An open source project to that makes animation out of quaternion expressions. Remember analytic geometry, where writing y = x[sup]2[/sup] generated a picture? The same expression can now generate a short film. Drummer Farms Condominiums Designed web site for condominium association using an open source Content Management System (CMS) called Drupal. Has slide shows and video walk throughs of units. All condominium documents and newsletters are online. Owners can see password protected minutes. Physics background Doing physics with quaternions This research project entails trying to reformulate all the fundamental equations of physics. The reason for such a large task is to start from one core hypothesis: events from any object in spacetime are described by the mathematics of a topological algebraic field, known as the quaternions. This is an old goal, but Doug has made a number of new insights, including a new way of expressing the Maxwell equations. Publication record Attended the Second Meeting on Quaternionic Structures in Mathematics and Physics in Roma, Italy, September 1999. Presented a paper entitled \"Maxwell's vision: electromagnetism with Hamilton's quaternions\", available at http://www.univie.ac.at/EMIS/proceedings/QSMP99/index.html.

In the early days of the text-heavy Internet, there were newsgroups on all kinds of subjects that would allow people to exchange emails about the topic at hand. When information had to go through a dialup modem, text was the road to take. The unmoderated newsgroup sci.physics was a soapbox for crank physicists. One guy loved to write \"TIME IS MASS\". While amusing, it was not worthy of much time or mass. The most important feature of SPR as it was sometimes called was that Prof. John Baez and a few of his friends posted tehre regularly. Baez loved to teach, often at great length. There was a farmer from England who called himself \"Oz\" that Baez spent a big effort trying to teach some quite obscure mathematical physics concepts. The battlez between Oz and the Wizard were fun and informative to read. I would toss in my own two cents once in a while. Much of what Baez wrote would not stick in my brain since it was dense with math jargon. On the occassion when these obscure discussion did reach me, it made the time investment worthwhile. Mathematical physics is a difficult art, so it was nice when I felt I understood a subtle issue. Every community has its characters. A few times a year, Lubos%C5% Motl A few times a year, Lubos Motl would jump into a thread. If you know Lubos, you know Lubos. The comments would get sharper, more biting when Lubos joined the discussion.Lubos was strongly of the opinion that work on strings was the correct direction to go. If you disagreed, then you were a complete and total moron. I wondered if he was real or a bit of fiction. Lubos Motl is real. It became clear to me after one exchange that I could not have a rational argument with the man. He was right, I was wrong. He does have a number of technical accomplishments. I have seen him lucidly describe issues in high energy physics. In a programming contest sponsored by CERN to write a program to pluck out a signal from a large dataset, I know he was in the running but did not track his final place. He is active on the Internet. At physics.stackexchange.com, he has over 130k reputation points. I have 34, total. A question I posed myself was how to deal with him. Rational discussions were rules out. A bet would not work since we are not of equal stature in the physics community. I wanted something one-sided and long term. My idea back in 2004 was to write Lubos a check that I would mail him if any time in ten years there was a consensus in the physics community that more than four dimensions were needed to describe gravity and the standard model. Here are the two checks because I changed banks somewhere in the middle: This is my documentation that I believe Lubos is wrong about the direction physics should go. In 2014, I did not send him the check. When grounded in current high energy physics, I will listen to his views. I am a skeptic, which means to me I will invest a small amount of effort to understand another person's vision. With Lubos, I am a cynic, one who dismisses the argument withoug any efforts because of my perception of a bad track record. I know people are cynical about my work (see the Becket quaote at the end of this blog). I ignore is promotion of work on strings. Note, I now always use the phrase \"work on strings\" because such research never formed a scientific theory, a coherent intellectual structure that can be used to make many predictions confirmed by experiment. In the Spring of 2015, I came up with a new approach to gravity. That story was detailed in the previous blog. The starting point is to carefully consider the square of a quaternion. Surely someone else has already thought about this. A Google search brought me to this question on physics.stackexchange.com which I will quote in full : I recently realised that quaternions could be used to write intervals or norms of vectors in special relativity: ![](quaternion_squared_question.png) Is it useful? Is it used? Does it bring anything? Or is it just funny? Isaac, March 20, 2011, 939 reputation points People ask questions on physics stackexchange because they don't know the answer. Often the question itself is not well-formed. I know I have made that mistake myself. In those cases, comments are posed right under the question which then gets edited until the question is well-formed and people provide suggested answers. The one line of math is not well-formed for three different reasons. Let me go from mini, to minor, silent, to train wreck. The mini issue is that quaternions as a four vector have four basis elements, not just three. To make the basis for the time term explicit instead of implicit, I have often used the letter \"e\" to complete the collection with i, j, and k. The minor issue is that one should not mix the tuple notation - the paratheses - with the vector notation. It took quite a bit of polite pestering from David Halliday for me to finally see that issue. The lefthand side should be written as: Pick one and stick with it. I favor the first form since it uses fewer marks on a page. Note that either way it is written, there is no subscript or a superscript. I call this the silent error. In mathematics, a vector can be added to another vector or multiplied by another scalar. In physics, a 4-vector means something more specific. Not only does it have those qualities, but it also lives in either a tangent or a cotangent space of a manifold. That is signified by the subscript or superscript. An interval results by contracting with a metric tensor. In flat space-time, there is one tangent or cotangent space for all. In curved space-time, every point has its own tangent space. One has to specify the path to do any calcultion of an interval since different paths will have different sets of tangent spaces. This is different from a quaternion-based calculation where there is only one rule for calculating squares. Apple, meet orange. Quaternions work in the manifold, the special relativity interval is in the tangent space of the manifold. A quaternion multiplied by a quaternion generates a quaternion. The train-wreck error was that the result of the calculation was plain old-fashioned wrong. Here is a pedantic way to write the square of a quaternion: The fact that the original poster ignored thre three imaginary terms is interesting. It shows the bias of talking about what is familiar, ignoring the strange. The Lorentz invariant interval of special relativity is familiar. The terms I call space-times-time - (2tx, 2ty, 2tz) - are not. The top voted reply by Peter Morgan was a suggestion to go study Clifford algebas, reading what John Baez has written about often on SPR and kept on his web site. Further study is always a good thing, but why not stay focused on the question at hand? Morgan writes out all the correct terms for the square of a quaternion in his answer: Isaac, this is how I think your derivation ought to go, if we just use The xy,yz,zx terms cancel nicely, but the tx, ty, tz terms don't, unless we do as Lubo\u0161 did and introduce the conjugate q<super>*</super>=t\u2212ix\u2212jy\u2212kz. This, however, doesn't do what I take you to be trying to do. So, instead, ... STOP. There is no need for an instead. Why does Morgan presume that the three space-times-time terms must be equal to zero? As John Baez has pointed out, a metric tensor is a machine that can take in two 4-vectors and spit out one number in return. A metric tensor has formally nothing to say about the three space-times-time terms. Silence does not mean zero. If one starts with four pieces of information with an event, then one should end up with four pieces of information so that information is not lost. The standdard approach to calculating intervals does lose information. If you have two observers and those two observers are moving at a constant velocity to each other along the x axix only, we know the following: Seeing the two intervals are equal will say that the two observers are moving at a constant velocity to each other. It also says nonthing about what that motion is. An analysis of the three space-times-time terms will reveal the exact motion. That is great information to know. Space-times-time data is useful. The invariant interval of special relativity can be represent using analytic geometry. The familiar light cone has hyperbolas that are curves with equal intervals. I could write three such graphs for each of the imaginary sptial directions, but have combined them for simplicity. The time like intervals are always positive real numbers. The space-like intervals are always negative real numbers. An interval of zero is a path only the massless photon and gluon can travel. Now ask the question in reverse: what if two observers agree to the space-times-time value, but disagree about the interval? What area of physics is involved? The only subject I know where the metric changes is gravity. If one insists on preserving the space-times-time value and being consistent with weak gravitational field tests, open up Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler to equation 40.2: Observers at different hieghts in a gravitational field will make different measurements of dt, dx, dy, and dz. The intervals will be different. Yet their space-times-time calculations will be the same. Use analytic geometry to draw constant space-times-time curves: This graph is the light cone graph rotated by 45 degrees. The constant space-times-time hyperbolas are positive or negative imaginary numbers. We finally get to Lubos's reply. I will quote it in full: It's just funny. Note that your equation doesn't actually use any single general quaternion. You only use the i,j,ki,j,k imaginary units in an *ad hoc* way to get three minus signs whenever you need them. If you were using an actual quaternion ![](q_vector.png) then the only semi-natural real bilinear invariant you may construct out of it is ![](q_norm.png) so the 4 real components in a quaternion still have the Euclidean, rather than Minkowskian, signature. But even for a 4-dimensional Euclidean space, the quaternions are actually just a game because we haven't really used the main nontrivial structure of the quaternions, their multiplication, in any nontrivial way. Quaternions are not genuine quaternions if you never use the relations *ij=\u2212ji=k* and its cyclic permutations - and we haven't used them above. We only used the fact that *i, j* etc. anticommute with each other, but we didn't really care what their product is. Because we haven't really used those relations, we haven't used full quaternions - except as a meaningless bookkeeping device. In the same way, one may organize 8 real numbers under the umbrella of a single \"octonion\" except that if the complicated and cool octonion multiplication table - with the G<sub>2</sub> automorphism group - is never employed, it's clear that the \"octonion\" interpretation was just a game to give a name to a collection of 8 numbers. But not every collection of 4 or 8 numbers deserves to be called \"quaternion\" and \"octonion\", even though, of course, one may get the individual components out of the \"quaternion\" and \"octonion\", too. In the very same way, a general pair of two real numbers is simply not a complex number. By its very essence, a complex number must act as one number - so there must be a notion of holomorphy required somewhere or everywhere in the formalism - rather than two numbers. The references linked in the other answers don't understand the purpose and relevance of all those mathematical structures, so they lead to incorrect answers to the fundamental question whether the trick is real or just a fun. The right answer is that it is just a fun, and your fun even used a wrong signature that differs from a somewhat more natural fun. This is a defensible position. As such, I have no doubt if asked today Lubos will still consider it a flawless answer. My comments that follow are not directed toward Lubos who has demonstrated the intellectual flexibility of a stapler. Rather it is for the entertainment of people who like taking down folks with more than 130,000 reputation points. Lubos completely ignores the original poster's question which is typical of his sytle. There is nothing ad hoc about the rule for multiply quaternions on a four dimensional real manifold to assure that an inverse exists unless the quaternion is zero. The original post was asking about something that is central to special relativity, the real-valued interval. Here is the misdirection play: ...then the only semi-natural real bilinear invariant you may construct out of it is... I have no notion of what \"semi-natural\" might mean. What does it take to be fully natural? All that is going on is that Lubos is making a similar assumption that if one does an operation to get the Lorentz invariant interval, the other terms necessarily should be zero. That cannot be done with quaternions, and that is a good thing. The real flaw in the statement is the inclusion of the word \"invariant\". Invariant by itself is meaningless. One is required to list the transformations that keep the value invariant. The rotation group SO(3) would point the imaginary spatial vector in a new direction leaving the norm unchanged. The group U(1) would also neave the quaternion norm unaltered. The group U(1) is the gauge group symmetry of electromagnetism. Quaternions are a normed division algebra. Since the norm of U(1) is one, that would mean anytime one took the norm of a quaternion expression - no matter how complicated - that norm would be invariant if multiplied by a member of U(1). The same goes for the unitary quaternion SU(2) which is the gauge group for the weak force. This is the power of using quaternions as a unified algebra. Anytime one takes the norm of any quaternion expression, we know that norm will not change under an electro-weak tranformation without doing a thing. I consider that fully natural. Lubos makes the same trainwreck error that the original poster did. A quaternion times the conjugate of a quaternion creates a quaternion. The right answer for the calculation of the norm is: The full quaternion algebra is required for all these calcellations. There is often interesting physics at nearby point. Think about (q+dq)q * . The nieghborhood of norm will use the three imaginaries. Do I know of even one problem in physics that can be addressed by exploring the neighborhood of a norm? The direct answer is no. Since I have both U(1) and SU(2) symmetry, it does strike me as something that is worth further study. Anytime one has a simple agelbraic expression, it means there is a graph one should generate. The symmetry of U(1) is known as a unit circle in a complex plane: All three spatial dimensions are bundled together as one imaginary factor. If the three imaginaries are kept separate, a graph of SU(2) results which I am suggeting as a sphere: To be honest, I don't deeply understand these graphs at this point. That can be a sign one is doing research: things are precisely defined but all the implications are not clear. One can be inside the circle or sphere, on the circle or sphere, or outsite. It will take many particles to create such a structure since half the points have a space-like separation. How exactly is this related to charge conservation? Lubos wrote \"so the 4 real components in a quaternion still have the Euclidean, rather than Minkowskian, signature. I call this sophisticated garbage. The Minkowski metric tensor thakes two 4-vectors and returns one real number. The elements along the diagonal of the 4x4 matrix are +--- or -+++ for a signature of +2 or -2 respectively. If instead one works with a Euclidean metric tensor, then all the elements on the diagonal are ++++ for a signature of +4. Quaternions don't use a metric tensor. Ever. QUaternions are neither covariant nor contravariant 4-vectors living in a tangent space. If one represents a quaternion as a matrix, onlyt the first term of that lives along the diagonal of the 4x4 matrix. The signature of the matrix is either +4 or -4, depending only on the sign of the first term. There is nothing wrong with working with both the square of a quaternion and the norm of a quaternion. This is different from the situation using metric tensors where such a choice needs to be addressed. It was great to read this: In the very same way, a general pair of two real numbers is simply not a complex number. By its very essence, a complex number must act as one number - so there must be a notion of holomorphy required somewhere or everywhere in the formalism - rather than two numbers. Initially, I did think of a quaternion only as a collection of rules one applies to four real numbers. With complex numbers, one does not have to deal exclusively with the manifold R 2 as they are always introduced. Instead one can work with the complex manifold. One then works with z and its conjugate z * . With a quaternion manifold, two more conjugates are required. The first conjugate will keep one of the spatial elements positive while flipping the other three terms. The second conjugate will keep a different spatial element positive while filling the other three. To keep the sign of the third one the same while flipping all the others, no more conjugates are required. Instead, multiply by minus one times all three conjugates to do the job. There are few people who think about quaternions as more than just funny, and fewer still who consider it to be one number. It was this idea of a quaternion as one number that drove me to develop space-time numbers. I have blogged about them earlier. Instead of four numbers, there are 8 just like the quaternion group Q 8 . Space-times-time numbers do not use the real number, starting instead with more basic incredient like zero, one, and the set of positive numbers. There is an equivalence relation so one can always go from the space-times-time numbers to quaternions. Quaternion bashing is an old sport. With little effort, one could cite the literature in support of of Lubos' replay. Let's compile of list of \"just funny\" links one can make between the two simple quaternion functions of a square and norm with physics. Start with two observers looking at the difference between two events (which eliminates the need to agree about the origin). Let both observers square the values they obtained. If both intervals are the same, then the space-times-time values can be used to figure out how one observer is moving steadily relative to the other. If the three space-times-time values are identical, then the difference in the invervals can be used to determine the difference in GM/c 2 R between betweeen the two observers. If the norms are the smae, then there exists both a U(1) and an SU(2) transformation between the two. At this point, I have not idea what that means. I do believe that someday it will be useful. I like betting against Lubos.","title":"bet against Lubos"},{"location":"Blogs/Discovery/discovery/","text":"Discovering a New Approach to Gravity The process by which I came up with a new aproach to gravity will be sketched. Due to the constraints of a full time job and family, and being middle aged, I don't have good documentation about what exactly happened when, so this is more impressionistic than something based on careful autobiographical notes. In the Spring ot 2016, I was thinking again about the square of a difference quaternion: Filed away in my brain was a quote from Abraham Pais' most excellent scientific biography of Albert Einstein, \"Subtle is the Lord...\", right in the introduction: Were I asked for a one-sentence biography of Einstein, I would say, 'He was the freest man I have ever known.' Had I to compose a one-sentence scientific biography of him, I would write, \"Better than anyone before or after him, he knew how to invent invariance principles and make use of statistical fluctuations.' Looking at the square of the difference quaternion, the first term is the invariant interval for inertial observers at the cor of special relativity. That term is the reason I purchased quaternions.com in 1997. Oh, and some other stuff. I always wanted the other three terms to have a name. I know I asked on sci.physics.research what the three terms should be called, but that post to the moderated newsgroup was not awswered. The Spring of 2016, I came up with a reasonable name of (2 dt dx, 2 dt dy, 2 dt dz) - space-times-time. The name describes exactly what it happens to be. When two inertial observers agree on the interval between two events, their space-times-time will be different. The precise difference of the space-times-time values can be used to calculate how the two observers are moving relative to each other. What kind of physics results when two observers find the space-times-time values are invariant, but the intervals are different? I thought that was a good question.This is what I did in the the days after the question was posed... Nothing. I have a crazy number of constraints in my life between work, family, diabetes, and this research effort. With so little freedom, I have to make good choices about what questions are good to think about. While walking the dog or shopping for 2% milk for my daughter, I questioned how good was the question itself? Einstein figured out the physics of special relativity. The physics had logical consequences such as two inertial observers could disagree about events being simultaneous. He was not a math guy. Eventually he was told that the interval was calculated using a metric tensor contracting contravariant 4-vectors. He figured out based on his deep thinking about physics, that such a metric would have to be dynamic in order to explain gravity. What if instead, Einstein had been told that the math he was doing used the square of a quaternion? That would not change the ability to do any problems in special relativity. I say this based on taking 8.033, Classical and Relativitic Mechanics at MIT in the fall of 1997 and solving every problem set using quaternions (50+ problems in all). I have no doubt that in such an alternative history, in less than two months we would have a simple set of logical questions. Consider two observers looking at a pair of events. They both calculate the difference between the events. They then square this difference. What is the relationship between the two observers in these four cases: Both observers agree on the interval and the space-times-time. Both observers agree on the interval and disagree on the space-times-time. Both observers disagree on the interval and agree on the space-times-time. Both observers disagree on the interval and space-times-time. Case 1 is simple. Nature is consistent. The observers are not moving relative to each other. There is no material difference between the two. Case 2 is special relativity. Case 3 requires some thought. Case 2 covers observers travelling at a constant velocity relative to each other, inertial observers, so this must be a different situation, non-inertial observers. How could they agree on their space-times-time? One would have to go up while the other went down. Imagine two observers. One is lying down on the surface of a planet, the other is up high, carried aloft by some balloons. Balloon girl's heart will be able to beat faster since she is not under as much stress from gravity. Her meter stick will expand too. When she makes a measurement of a pair of events, the time difference will increase due to the faster heart beat while the measured distance will be smaller with a larger meter stick. The lying down man would experience the opposite effects. His heart would beat more slowly while his meter stick got more compressed. That would make the measurements of a time difference larger, but of a distance difference smaller. In physics, details matter. While it is the case that boing higher in a gravitational field does make the measurements of time increase and space decrease, how do they change exactly? With general relativity, the answer cannot be answered until one has said explicitly what is the choice of coordinates. At some point, I wondered, could there be any overlap between the space-times-time invariance proposal for gravity and standard general relativity? The chapter I studied most closely in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler was Chapter 40, \"Solar-System Experiments\". The first unnumbered equation is the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild spherical coordinates. Here is a minor rewrite, the Cartesian form: It is easy to construct an ad hoc proposal that would be consistent with this result of solving the Einstein field equations and the space-times-time invariance as gravity proposal:","title":"Discovery"},{"location":"Blogs/Electromagnetism_and_gravity/electromagnetism_and_gravity/","text":"Electromagnetism in a gravity field for the quaternion gravity proposal Gravity is king, effecting everything. In this blog, the details of gravity's effects on light will be detailed for both general relativity and the space-times-time invariance as gravity proposal. This analysis leads to an experiment to see which description of gravity is correct. Someday the data will decide. Light is bent by gravity in both theory and practice. Einstein considered the path light would follow if viewed by an accelerating elevator. To such an observer, light appears to bend. The equivalence principle of general relativity says that gravity is indistinguishable from the accelerating elevator except for tidal effects. Newton's scalar theory of gravity also predicts light will bend to gravity. As a scalar field theory, it predicts one kind of bending, the g 00 term.. General relativity has that same term plus the effects of the curvature of space of the same size, so the predicted change is twice as big for GR. In 1919, the first results came in supporting the predictions of general relativity in an experiment using photographic plates exposed during a total eclipse. It took the advent of radio telescopes to significantly increase our confidence in the experimental results because a rare total eclipse is not required for such studies. By measuring the change of radio sources as they approached the Sun, a more complete picture of light bending at different distances from the Sun was done. Radar has been reflected off of planets. General relativity has accurately predicted the time delay of those reflections. A fun prediction was Einstein rings. Imagine a strong source of light very far away such as a pulsar. Over those billions of light years, there happens to be a galaxy right in the way. This would lead to gravitational lensing. Light from the quasar would bend around the lens galaxy, so the quasar's light would form a ring. Since the lens is an accident of the history and evolution of the Universe, the ring is not perfect. Yet one can build models that match the data. No doubt one could construct Newtonian rings, but that exercise is not done due to the success of general relativity. The path of light through a gravitational field is the subject of all of the cited studies. But what about the electric and magnetic fields themselves? The math story is very clear: the electric field E and magnetic field B are unchanged by gravity . Mathematicians say one uses an exterior derivative to calculate these two fields using an antisymmetric, rank-2 tensor. Write out the definition of the electromagnetic field strength tensor using covariant derivatives: There are a number of assumptions that go into this calculation. There are a great many choices one could make about the connection. I use the ones that are the basis of standard general relativity, that the connection is metric compatible and torsion-free. The Christoffel symbols of the second kind (Arfken subspecies) are symmetric for a change in the paired indexes. One says that the electromagnetic field strength tensor is \"manifestly covariant\". Consider a box with a stable electric and magnetic field in it. Move that box anywhere you like in a gravitational field, even close to a black hole. The strength of the E and B field will not change. What will change is a measurement of the energy density of that field. The reasons is that the energy depends on the sum of squares of these two fields. The squaring operation requires the use a metric tensor which does vary as one moves around a gravitational field. There is still a problem with claiming that neither field changes. We know that general relativity says that in a gravity field, the time portion of a measurement will get smaller while the space measurement gets bigger. Write out the definition: The electric field E has two parts: a time operator acting on a spatial potential and a spatial operator acting on a temporal potential. If temporal things get smaller, that might balance out the increase in the spatial terms. The same cannot be said about the magnetic field B . A spatial operator acting on a spatial potential can only grow larger. In general relativity, there is an additional requirement. All elements used must transform as tensors. It is this requirement that leads to a term that removes any change to the magnetic field B . The details of the math tool trumps physical interpretation. This is neither a good nor bad thing. In terms of logical consistency, it would be nonsense to say there magnetic field is the one thing that does not transform like a tensor since it is part of the second rank anti-symmetric field strength tensor. This is the first time however that I can say I have an issue with general relativity that has to do with the physical logic. If time-like things get smaller, and space-like things get larger, than the magnetic field must get larger due to gravity. What physical reason is there to expect an eletric field to behave differently from a magnetic field since both are part of the same electromagentic field? I think of the electric field as a measure of quantized electric charge. Say there were only three such charges in a volume. It would not matter where those three charges were in a gravity field, the electric field stays the same. The magenetic field would be those three charges in motion. It is motion that is always effected by gravity. Therefore magnetism, charges in motion, must be changed due to where it is in a gravitational field. There is another way to see that the current situation with electromagnetism and general relativity is odd. Imagine a pair of identical boxes that have a certain electric and magnetic field inside of them. One box is closer to a gravitational source than the other. To figure out the metric tensor, one could send a photon from the lower box to the upper box and determine how much the photon was gravitationally redshifted. Thus one is using a photo to determine the gravitational field. A photon is an excitation of the eletromagnetic field. It seams odd to me that only the travelling photon can know about the change in the gravitational field and not the fields themselves. Big Consequences to Being a Little Different This blog has provided a few physical reasons to argue that while an electric field might not change in a gravity field, there is a way to justifying the magnetic field would change. However space changes in a gravity field, magnetism is only uses spatial terms. Magnetism is charge in motion, and motion is what is altered by gravity. It is not logically consistent to use photons to detail the strength of a gravity field but not be able to do the same with the electric and magnetic fields themselves. The math machinery of exterior derivatives is clear, consistent, and well-studied. The curl is independent of the metric, so there is no way it can change due to changes in the metric tensor. One would need to abandon tensors. Yet one cannot abandon tensors because tensors cover everything, even real and complex numbers. The real and complex numbers are tensors of rank 0. They have their own \"private\" rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Those rules do not change in flat or curved space-time. They are effectively \"on for the ride\" when one decides coordinates, picks metrics and connections, and all that jazz. In my work, I only use tensors of rank 0 for every step of the mathematical analysis of patterns of events in space-time. This makes the logic of operations universal no matter what kind of physics domain is in play: classical, relativistic, quantum or combinations of these.","title":"Electromagnetism in a gravity field for the quaternion gravity proposal"},{"location":"Blogs/Electromagnetism_and_gravity/electromagnetism_and_gravity/#electromagnetism-in-a-gravity-field-for-the-quaternion-gravity-proposal","text":"Gravity is king, effecting everything.

It was my responsibility to give the peer-review system a try with the paper \"Quaternion Space-Times-Time Invariance as Gravity\". This effort was doomed because I am not a peer of a Ph.D. level physicist. I cannot walk their walk, cannot talk their talk. And of course the idea could be wrong. I submitted the paper to the Journal Classical and Quantum Gravity. I have never been able to read and understand an abstract in that journal because it was too dense with jargon. The title of the jorunal did sound relevant. Here was the abstract I submitted: Abstract The square of a quaternion luckily has the Lorentz invariant interval of special relativity as its first term. The other three space-times-time terms are commonly ignored. Ways to vary a quaternion with a continuous function that leave the interval in the square invariant are discussed. One method uses exponentials, leading to the hyperbolic functions found useful in special relativity. Using the same approach to keep the space-times-time invariant leads to a dynamic interval term. By preserving the space-times-time terms using an exponential function and the geometric source mass, an interval term is found that is similar but experimentally distinct from the Schwarzschild metric applied to space-time 4-vectors. Space-times-time invariance is not a field theory, so gravitons are not necessary and quantization is moot. The paper was given to one reviewer who provided this one line critique: The scientific level of the paper is much below standards adopted in the Classical and Quantum Gravity Journal. As this is one line, there is not much one can learn from the limited time and effort the reviewer devoted to the paper. The paper was so much below standards that nothing specific needed to be pointed out. We will never know what was the reason for the one line reject. Here are a few possibilities: I used a home address, not one from a University. This says to the reviewer that we are not peers, I live in a much lower level cave. In my experience, most such works are not worthy of comment. I have had one exception from an engineer in Mexico city about quaternion triple products and gamma matrices. \"Quaternions\" were in the title, abstract, and paper. In my experience, about half of very technical folks don't know what a quaternion is. If the reviewer had no working knowledge of quaternion, the paper would be dead on the first word in the title. A good third of the folks who do know about quaternions hold them in disdain, a leftover from Lord Kelvin's contempt. \"Space-times-time\" is a made up word. Guilty, but what was I supposed to do? Not a field theory? No. N. O. Newton's theory of gravity is a scalar field theory. Einstein's general relativity is a metric field theory. All sensible proposal for gravity to date have been field theories. Climb on board. Gravitons are not necessary? The name of the journal is \"Classical and Quantum Gravity\". People get jobs in quantum gravity. You cannot have a field theory without a particle to mediate it (true by the way, but quaternion gravity is like special relativity, math rules for all calculations and thus not a field). The reviewer read the entire article, looked at the references, and concluded the scientific level was well below the standard adopted by \"Classical and Quantum Gravity\". Reviewers are not paid. They are busy. One or a combination of these could explain the one-liner. I learned of a nice way to be more formal in the description of this work. I had to pay 50 reputation points at math.stackexchange.com, but it was well worth it. The proposal depends on a math idea known as equivalence classes. An equivalence class in an operation on a structure that preserves that structure while having the properties of being reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. In order to think about intervals in space-time using quaternion requires two preliminary steps. First one must look at the difference between events. What this does is eliminate any role for the origin where an observer happens to be. Imagine one had three observers lined up in a row each one meter apart looking at a pair of events. Each would have different values for the spatial terms for the individual events, but the dq (delta quaternion) could be the same. The next requirement concerns the choice of coordinates. This is a subject where my lack of education costs me. I know how to make what I call a distance function (call it D) in Euclidean coordinates. Here you do nothing. Unlike what people expect, the distance function has four parts to it because changing math structure is evil in my book. I know how to create a distance function in cylindrical (t, r, theta, z) and spherical coordinates (t, r, theta, phi). I would also assert but be unable to prove that no matter what choice one makes for coordinate systems in space-time, there must exist a distance function that can be created with quaternions such that the first term of the square of D(dq) is identical to a 4-vector metric contraction. This whole discussion needs to be couched in differential geometry language which I don't speak. Too bad for my team. The bottom line is that I am studying equivalence classes of the square of distance functions on delta quaternions of events in space-time. Imagine two observers looking at the same pair of events in space-time. Due to difference between the observers, the two delta quaternions are not the same: dq != dq'. As a consequence, neither the distance function, nor the square of the distance function of the delta quaternions are not equal either. Why are they not equal? In the first case, the primed observer is moving at a steady velocity relative to the other observer. Special relativity can be interpreted as this equivalence class: Let me read this one off. The distance functions on a delta quaternion are both quaternions. We say the two are equivalent if the real part (the funny looking R) of the square of the distance function on the delta quaternions are the same. I claim that is a different way to describe special relativity. The focus is on what is invariant instead of on group theory or transformation properties, both of which are valid approaches to special relativity. The imaginary part will necessarily be different. Those differences could be used to determine precisely how the primed observer is moving relative to the unprimed observer. This is a good additional feature to have. In the second case, the two observers are not moving relative to each other. Instead they are at different distances from a gravitational source. The quaternion gravity proposal is that this approximate symmetry in the standard approach is actually exact: This time they are equivalent if the imaginary parts are equal. This means that the real part is different. Emotional Response to the Rejection Nature doesn't care if we understand gravity. I don't care if the physics community does either. The review was what I expected. I cannot change my affiliation (none) which makes the odds of acceptance under 2%. I need quaternions everywhere, lower that by 50%, then the quqaternion cynics are a third of that. A made up word like \"space-times-time\" takes another 50% cut. The starting odds are under 0.2%. The odds are greater that 80% that the reviewer has written a technical paper on quantum gravity and 100% that the reviewer has peers who have written such papers. Admitting the entire research effort into quantum gravity is wrong - and that is interesting - is not part of high scientific level supported by journals. I did spend a few moment wondering about life if the paper had been accepted. It would be interesting, but the stress level would be absurd. This paper was a form of intellectual insurance. If the core idea here is wrong, this blog and CQG-102165 do not matter. If the core idea is right, it is the tradition of science that correct ideas eventually get recognized and obliterate much of the work in vogue. Such a shift requires a social nucleus with technical credibility.","title":"Paper CQG-102165 on Quaternion Gravity Rejected"},{"location":"Blogs/Paper/paper/#paper-cqg-102165-on-quaternion-gravity-rejected","text":"In the Spring of 2015, I developed a new approach to gravity.

I did spend a few moment wondering about life if the paper had been accepted. It would be interesting, but the stress level would be absurd. This paper was a form of intellectual insurance. If the core idea here is wrong, this blog and CQG-102165 do not matter. If the core idea is right, it is the tradition of science that correct ideas eventually get recognized and obliterate much of the work in vogue. Such a shift requires a social nucleus with technical credibility.","title":"Emotional Response to the Rejection"},{"location":"Blogs/Space-time_numbers/space-time_numbers/","text":"Quaternions versus Space-time Numbers The history of the 4D division algebra know as quaternions will be lightly sketched. Are these good enough to describe all the patterns of events in space-time? I will argue that two specific issues dealing with the rules of addition and multiplication require a variation on quaternions I call \"space-time numbers.\" It is simple enough to convert a space-time number into a quaternion (but not the reverse). ** The Multiple Discoveries of Quaternions A quaternion is a division algebra like the real and complex numbers, but with four degrees of freedom. Gauss was the first to work out the algebra in one of his notebooks. He did not publish the results, possibly thinking they were not interesting enough. Today, most practical physicists do not consider quaternions to be worthy of much study. Rodrigues figured out how to use quaternions to do rotations in three dimensional space. There are several technical reasons why rotations should always be done with quaternions instead of Euler angles, but I will skip a detailed discussion of that subject. Rotations in 3D space remain the one-trick-pony use of quaternions by both rocket scientists and game designers. Hamilton spent a decade trying to figure out a consistent set of rule to add, subtract, multiply and divide triplets of numbers. The first three are easy, but making sure division always works cannot be done with triplets. Hamilton realized on a walk with his wife that a fourth number was required, leading to a famous bit of vandalism as he carved the rules onto a bridge. The \"fourness\" of this new number was such a jump for Hamilton that he included it in the name itself, the quaternions. Hamilton was so adverse to the 4D nature of quaternions that the day after his discovery, he created the \"pure quaternion\" where the first term was zero. I have not become a scholar of his efforts since many of his contemporaries where unable to understand his written works. The rules of quaternion algebra are simple and should be familiar to those who have worked with complex numbers and vector algebra. A quaternion is a four dimensional vector space over the real numbers. This means they can be added, subtracted, or multiplied by a scalar. Care must be used to not call a quaternion a 4-vector, a term that appears in differential geometry that brings tangent and cotangent spaces into play. As a vector space over the real numbers, quaternions are a group with the addition operator. The identity element is zero. To andle the multiplication operator, one needs a few rules: One can make different choices for the signs, but this is the set that Hamilton used. For use in symbolic math packages, I have found the 4x4 real matrix representation is useful: The matrix representation has the rules of multiplicaiton built in. Because it is a matrix, it also has addition and what is necessary to invert the matrix. The inverse of this matrix is the transpose of the matrix which always necessarily exists divided by the norm of the matrix which is the sum of the squares of each real-valued term. Technical note: I define the norm as the product of a quaternion with its conjugate: Notice the 3 zeroes. What is usually done is not include the three zeroes. They matter to me for two reasons. First, the product of two quaternions is necessarily another quaternion. This is obvious when one does programming since the data structure stays the same. Second, much of calculus is the study of change near interesting points. There may be times one want to study say q * (q+da), then nothing needs to be modified. [end note] The norm will only equal zero for the zero quaternion. Therefore a multiplicative inverse will exist in all cases except for zero, just as is the case for the real and imaginary numbers. For completeness, it should be noted that a quaternion can also be represented by a 2x2 matrix with complex values. In my own experience with Mathematica, the complex representation led to odd results. A quaternion can be viewed as a Clifford algebra , specifically Cl 0, 2 (R). Clifford algebras are also know as geometric algebra based on a modern outreach effort by David Hestenes using the term Clifford did as being more descriptive. That goal is to have a big tent of algebras, picking the one that best fits the job at hand. This is different from my own research work which is to find one structure that is powerful enough to do it all as Nature does it all. The real and complex numbers are Cl 0, 0 (R) and Cl 0, 1 (R) respectively. Both the real and complex numbers are subgroups of quaternions. The real numbers are the diagonal of the matrix representation. There are three complex numbers in every equations: the diagonal plus any of the other three terms. One could also lump all three imaginary numbers together and the result is a complex number. Multiplication for real and complex numbers commutes, so they are both mathematical fields. The sum of these parts, the quaternions, by contrast is not a mathematical field because the order of multiplication matters to the cross product terms found in a quaternion. A quaternion with a norm of one is a way to represent the group SU(2), also known as a unit quaternion. A unit quaternion sits in the middle of the standard model, U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3). It remains an open riddle why the standard model has these three particular Lie groups. As is well-known, once you have SU(2), then U(1) is necessarily a subgroup of SU(2). It makes me speculate that a new approach to these symmetries might manage their natural overlap in a more compact way. Until such an idea can be made more precise, consider this an odd partical physics fantasy. ** Concerns About Quaternions Full disclosure: I own the domain quaternions.com whose tagline in \"Doing Physics with Quaternions.\" There are books and articles in the literature that claim that complex-valued quaternions are needed to derive the Maxwell equations or represent the Lorentz group. I can understand why one would have no interest in using quaternions given such limitations. Those are show stoppers. Yet I have succeeded in both cases with real-valued quaternions (and the answers are not that difficult once you know that an answer does exist). It is reasonable to suspect I am a zealot on the subject. I prefer to promote logical consistency. Nature uses one set of rules, so why don't physicists? Real and complex numbers come with enough mathematical structure to do calculus. Yet they are too small to work directly in classical three dimensional space without additional background mathematical structure, namely a vector space. Even that is not enough since there is no means to handle angular momentum. Quaternions can handle three classical dimensions, including the rotation. This should be an obvious point, but it is not. Since is an art of reductionism. The real numbers appear to be too complicated as a starting point. Addition utilizes the real number line wich is the fusion of the positive real numbers, then zero, then the negaitve real numbers. I appreciate how practical this is. Yet I see two sets of positve real numbers. One set is labeled \"positive\", the other \"negative\", but otherwise they are the same. The rule of multiplication can be found in the Abelian sign group Z 2 . This opens up the reductionist question about the trivial group Z 1 . Using zero and one, there are three ways to represent the trivial group Z 1 . (+, {0}) (*, {0}) (*, {1}) I found this intersing enough to devote an entire blog to the subject. The first two look like together they could form a mathematical field. There is a rule in the definition that disqualifies that because the trivial group cannot be changed. To me that is interesting, a logical contrast to calculus. Only the third representation of the trivial group can be used to form a continuous group. Only the third group can be used to form the positive and the negative real numbers. If one starts from the real numbers, then zero and one are just different points on the same line. Starting with the trivial group gives zero and one a more nuanced relationship. Quaternions as a vector space over four real numbers have four zeroes. For events in space-time, I call zero \"here-now\". Every observer should have but one here-now, not four. A star topology allows there to be one zero share amoungst eight unities: The origin is now quite complicated. In one area of study, relativistic quantum field theory, there is a notion of the sum of all possible histories. The odds of a series of events for particles going forward in time have to be added to the the events going backwards in time with the antiparticles. A star topology might allow for such a seamingly crazy pattern of paths. The rules for multiplication should come straight from group theory. The quaternion group Q 8 has the right name for the job. What is offputting is the \"eight\", twice as big as Hamilton's reveared four. Write out the product table for the quaternion group Q 8 : Although it might look like a square matrix, a product table is not equivalent to a matrix. Let me make the difference concrete. Square the simple quqaternions which is also a complex number (1, 2, 0, 0) to generate (-3, 4, 0, 0). Using the product table, one starts with 1 I 0 + 2 i 1 . and ends with 1 I 0 + 4 I 2 + 4 I 1 . It is also true that 1 I 0 + 4 I 2 = 3 I 2 . There is an equivalence relationship between working with the quaternion group Q 8 and Hamilton's 4D quaternions. To be equivaalent, one needs to reduce the Q 8 result. Reducing means to calculate the differences between the additive pairs (I 0 , I 2 ), (i 1 , i 3 ), (j 1 , j 3 ), and (k 1 , k 3 ). so that one or possibly both are zero. ** Space-time Numbers The needs of relativistic quantum field theory appear to require a new type of number, one that is a technical variation on Hamilton's 4D quaternions. I will call these numbers space-time numbers. The sets of positive real numbers labeled I 0 , i 1 , j 1 , and k 1 each have additive inverses, I 2 , i 3 , j 3 , and k 3 respectively. The discrete zero set {0} separates the two sides. Together, these four real lines - (I 0 , {0}, I 2 ), (i 1 , {0}, i 3 ), (j 1 , {0}, j 3 ), and (k 1 , {0}, k 3 ) - meet together at zero to form a star topology. Products are formed for space-time numbers using the product table of the quaternion group Q 8 . ** Nomemclature How should one write a space-time number? This is a minor challenge since we are all trained from the earliest days to use minus signs. My proposal is to use something I call doublet notation. We know two minus five is minus three. In the world of real numbers, that is just: 2 - 5 = -3 For doublet notation, we have places to store the two and the additive inverse of five: (2, 0) + (0, 5) = (2, 5) So where is the three? That is obtained by reducing this doublet. That means taking the difference between the two positions and letting the bigger one win like so: (2, 5) = (0, 3) When doing problems with algebra, it is often the case that one does not know what the sign is. In that case, the convension will be to keep the paratheses but drop the comma: (3, 0) + (x) = (0, 4) If one then goes and solves for x, the value is (0, 7). The only time one can skip the parantheses is for zero. For example, here is a norm as a quaternion and as a space-time number: q: (1, 2, 3, 4) * (1, -2, -3, -4) = (29, 0, 0, 0) stn: ((1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)) * (1, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)) = ((29, 0), 0, 0, 0) The space-time number norm comes in a reduced form. ** Why Bother? Classical mechanics, classical quantum mechanics, and relativistic quantum feild theory all have their own examples of simple harmonic motion. This is the equation that governs classical simple harmonic motion: Space is treated like a pure quaternion as Hamilton prefered. The operator is a pure scalar. Space and time do not mix as operators. This is the sign that the equation is classical. In classical quantum mechanics such as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, one time derivative and two spatial derivates act on the same wave function. In relativistic quantum field theory such as the Klein-Gordon equation, second order space and time derivatives act on the same wave function. Operators are extremely efficient means for describing patterns of numbers. Since operators are a summary tool, one would hope the same pattern could be seen in the numbers themselves. Perhaps problems in classical physics always use the reduced form of space-time numbers. There is no possibility of ambiguity about where a mass is in classical physics. In classical quantum mechanics, the time portion may well remain in the reduced form, while the spatial terms are not reduced, having non-zero values in a position and its additive inverse. In relativistic quantum field theory, it may be that all eight numbers are non-zero, a means to represent particles going forward in time and their antiparticles going backwards in time. ** Enormous Remaining Tasks for Space-time Numbers The definition of a derivative has long been established for both real and complex numbers. Since both of those numbers are subgroups of space-time numbers, they will apply when a space-time number is of that form. The more general definition of a derivative for a quaternion and these proposed space-time numbers continues to be an area of study in mathematics. The reason for the problem is that it is not obvious how to deal with the fact that the differential element does not commute in the limit definition. The differential element could go on the left or the right but the results are different. Some work with left-hand derivatives, but this approach appears to fail since one cannot show that a simple polinomial like q 2 is analytic in q. My own assessment is that mathematicians are trying to make baby steps away from the familiar limit definition. Instead, one should use lessons found in relativistic quantum field theory as a guide knowing the far more simple case for the derivative of real number derivatives is there when all the other complicated makes no contribution.

How does she enforce the same rules consistently on systems huge and tiny? My research if focused on the idea that we need to get number theory correct for space-time. The correct accounting system is needed for gransient events in space-time to appreciate Nature's strange and subtle rules. The target of this research is tensor calculus which is ubiquitous in theoretical physics. Physics is the study of change. Sir Isaac Newton was the first great mathematical physicist. He not only solved a tremendous range of problem sin physics using both theory and experiment, but he also developed calculus, the mathematical study of change. He conducted a flame war with the indepent discover of calculus by Liebnitz. The formal study of calculus is know as mathematical analysis. The starting point is a mathematical field. A mathematical field forms a group under addition. The field without zero is also a group under multiplication. The operations are associative. The distrubutive rule also must work. An idenity element exists for both addition and multiplication (one of the rules from group thoery). What comes before a field? What does not change? Two numbers are needed to think about events in space-time. Zero in space-time is here-now. The location is centered on an observer where the clock is in the present moment. One in space-time is there-then. It represents a signal an observer might see in the future. It is group theory that has brought order to the world of particle physics. Group theory is there for mathematical fields. The first group to start with is the trivial group. As the name suggests, there is only one member in the trivial group. Yet there are an infinite number of ways to represent the trivial group. This study is limited to zero and one. With zero, both the operators of addition and multiplication form the trivial group. Group property Addition + Multiplication * Closure 0 + 0 = 0 0 * 0 = 0 Associative (0 + 0) + 0 = 0 + (0 + 0) (0 * 0) * 0 = 0 * (0 * 0) Identity I = 0: 0 + I = 0 I = 0: 0 * I = 0 Communitive 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 0 * 0 = 0 * 0 Distributive 0 * (0 + 0) = 0 * 0 + 0 * 0 Zeroes are everywhere. One minor surpize might be the inverse for multiplication. Care was taken to not mention the familiar subrtraction and division operations. One reason to avoid these good old friends comes from the needs of the associative property. There will be many situations where: Only for the trivial group can it be said that the inverse of zero is zero. Dividing by zero remains a bad thing to do. For an observer, here-now remains here-now. Doesn't here now move forward in space-time? An observer goes from one here-now to the next here-now without paying any fee: 0+0=0. The trivial group represented by zero and using both the addition and multiplication operator does not represent a mathematical field. The technical definition of a mathematical field stipulates that the addition identity must be different from the multiplication identity. The trivial group remains trivial, unable to change. This may be a great thing: observers continue to observe, never able to close their eyes to the evolving Universe. Represent the trivial group with unity. This time the addition operator cannot be used because the requirement of closure is lost: 1+1=2. The multiplication operator with unity does form a group. Group property Addition + Multiplication * Closure 1 + 1 = 1 1 * 1 = 1 Associative (1 + 1) + 1 = 1 + (1 + 1) (1 * 1) * 1 = 1 * (1 * 1) Identity I = 1: 1 + I = 1 I = 1: 1 * I = 1 Communitive 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 1 * 1 = 1 * 1 The trivial group can be represented by unity and the multiplicaiton operator. It is different from both representations using zero because it can be used to make a continuous group. Take the set of all positive real numbers. Multipy those by zero and zero is the result. Multiply them by unity, and that forms a continuous group. For example, there is 4 and a fourth whose product is unity. The mathematician Giuseppe Peano was able to construct the set of natural numbers starting from zero and unity (see the Peano axioms ). With the natural (aka counting) numbers in hand, one can then construct the rational numbers using the multiplicative inverse. Which of the three representations of the trivial group discussed here should one use to do space-time physics? All three. The heart of physics beats from strong logical tensions. Everything in the Universe, great or small, observers the rest of the Universe, and can be observed by the rest of the Universe. The number zero, here-now, fits the job requirements of a ceaseless observer. The number one, there-then, can produce a signal to be observed later. Zero and one as representing the trivial group is pre-calculus because the trivial group does not allow for change. The fact that the unchangeable trivial group can be represented by both zero and one will have interesting reprocussions for the logic of physics.","title":"Zero and one"},{"location":"Classical_physics/classical_physics/","text":"Classical physics F = m A Simple harmonic oscillators and waves Conservative force tests","title":"Classical physics"},{"location":"Classical_physics/classical_physics/#classical-physics","text":"F = m A Simple harmonic oscillators and waves Conservative force tests","title":"Classical physics"},{"location":"Classical_physics/conservative_force.book/","text":"Four Tests for a Conservative Force There are four well-known, equivalent tests to determine if a force is conservative: the curl is zero, a potential function whose gradient is the force exists, all closed path integrals are zero, and the path integral between any two points is the same no matter what the path chosen.

A straight translation of terms could probably be automated with a computer program. What is more interesting is when an equation is generated by the product of operators acting on quaternion fields. I have found that generator equations often yield useful insights. A tensor is a bookkeeping device designed to keep together elements that transform in a similar way.

Therefore, express the stress tensor T in terms of the E and B fields only: Together, the energy density(W), Poynting's vector (Sa) and the Maxwell stress tensor (m_ab) are all the components of the stress tensor of the electromagnetic field. Generating a Symmetric 2-Tensor Using Quaternions How should one rationally go about to find a generator equation that creates these terms instead of using the month-long hunt-and-peck technique actually used? Everything is symmetric, so use the symmetric product: The fields E and B are kept separate except for the cross product in the Poynting vector.

The rest of that tensor is generated by the second line. The third line creates the Poynting vector. Using quaternions, the net sum of these terms ends up in the scalar. Does the generator equation have the correct properties? Switching the order of Ua and Ub leaves T unchanged, so it is symmetric. Check the trace, when Ua = Ub The trace equals zero, as it should. The generator is composed of three parts that have different dependencies on the unit vectors: those terms that involve Ua and Ub, those that involve Ua or Ub, and those that involve neither.

Switching x terms for y terms would flip the signs of the terms produced by the Poynting vector as required, but not the others. There are no terms of the form Ex^2, which is equivalent to the statement that the trace of the tensor is zero. On a personal note, I never thought I would understand what a symmetric 2-rank tensor was, even though I listen in on a discussion of the topic.

Hopefully after a 130 year wait, in this notebook we can begin that process. This approach relies on a judicious use of commutators and anticommutators. The Maxwell Equations The Maxwell equations are formed from a combinations of commutators and anticommutators of the differential operator and the electric and magnetic fields E and B respectively (for isolated charges in a vacuum. The first quaternion equation embodies the homogeneous Maxwell equations. The scalar term says that there are no magnetic monopoles. The vector term is Faraday's law. The second quaternion equation is the source term. The scalar equation is Gauss' law. The vector term is Ampere's law, with Maxwell's correction. The 4-Potential A The electric and magnetic fields are often viewed as arising from the same 4-potential A. These can also be expressed easily using quaternions. The electric field E is the vector part of the anticommutator of the conjugates of the differential operator and the 4-potential. The magnetic field B involves the commutator. These forms can be directly placed into the Maxwell equations. The homogeneous terms are formed from the sum of both orders of the commutator and anticommutator. The source terms arise from the difference of two commutators and two anticommutators. The Lorentz Force The Lorentz force is generated similarly to the source term of the Maxwell equations, but there a small game required to get the signs correct for the 4-force. This is the covariant form of the Lorentz force. The additional minus sign required may be a convention handed down through the ages. Conservation Laws The continuity equation--conservation of charge--is formed by applying the conjugate of the differential operator to the source terms of the Maxwell equations. The upper is zero, so the dot product of the E field and the current density plus the rate of change of the charge density must equal zero. That means that charge is conserved. Poynting's theorem for energy conservation is formed in a very similar way, except that the conjugate of electric field is used instead of the conjugate of the differential operator. Additional vector identities are required before the final form is reached. Use these equations to simplify to the following. This is Poynting's equation. Implications The foundations of classical electrodynamics are the Maxwell equations, the Lorentz force, and the conservation laws. In this notebook, these basic elements have been written as quaternion equations, exploiting the actions of commutators and anticommutators. There is an interesting link between the E field and a differential operator for generating conservation laws. More importantly, the means to generate these equations using quaternion operators has been displayed. This approach looks independent from the usual method which relies on an antisymmetric 2-rank field tensor and a U(1) connection.","title":"Classical Electrodynamics"},{"location":"EM/Maxwell_equations/#classical-electrodynamics","text":"Maxwell speculated that someday quaternions would be useful in the analysis of electromagnetism.

If something travels at the speed of light, there will be non of the the four gauge terms: The electric and magnetic field are unchanged by changing the guage because the gauge terms are always subtracted away. One enormous subject I have not looked into is what happens if one keeps this gauge term. The resulting physics must describe thing that do not travel at the speed of light.

It is scary, so start simple with one term only, E x : The magnetic field B x has everything not found in E x , including both the potentials and derivatives. It is seeing details like all four potential terms and all four differentials in each line that makes the Maxwell equations feel so complete. Multiply this out. Half the terms are positive, half are negative, setting up for cancellations. Each term has a t, x, y, z-ish part. 8 down, 16 to go. Clone E x to make E y and E z making all necessary subsitutions: Look for patterns in the partial derivatives: The electric field terms are in yellow. The top line has the magnetic field, B x . None of these has an x , it is pairs of y 's and z 's. The next part of the puzzle is to figure out where the rest of the derivative with respect to x go.

What is going on in terms of the E and B fields? Look at things row by row: The first line of the Lagrangian has two derivatives of phi with respect to x . After going through the Euler-Lagrange equation, one is left with a second order derivative which is the x derivative of the magnetic field. Rinse and repeat for y and z : These cancellations all happen because of a vector identity: the divergence of a curl is zero. Derive Faraday's law To continue down this longer road and arrive at Faraday's law, start from the same Lagrangian, but focus on the A x terms: The Euler-Lagrange will wipe out the A x 's, leading to cancellations.

Gauges are often chosen to make solving a particular problem easier. A few are well known: the Coulomb gauge for classical electromagnetism, the Lorenz gauge which makes electromagnetism look like a simple harmonic oscillator, and the gauge invariant form which is used in the Maxwell equations. In all these cases, the E and B field is the same, only the way it is measured is different. In this notebook, these are all generated using a differential quaternion operator and a quaternion electromagnetic potential. The Field Tensor F in Different Gauges The anti-symmetric 2-rank electromagnetic field tensor F has 3 properties: its trace is zero, it is antisymmetric, and it contains all the components of the E and B fields. The field used in deriving the Maxwell equations had the same information written as a quaternion: What makes this form gauge-invariant, so no matter what the choice of gauge (involving dphi/dt and Del.A), the resulting equation is identical? It is the work of the zero! Whatever the scalar field is in the first term of the generator gets subtracted away in the second term. A mathematical aside: a friend of mine calls this a \"conjugator\". The well- known commutator involves commuting two terms and then subtracting them from the starting terms. In this case, the two terms were conjugated and then subtracted from the original. Any quaternion expression that gets acted on by a conjugator results in a 0 scalar and a 3-vector. An anti-conjugator does the opposite task. By adding together something with its conjugate, only the scalar remains. The conjugator will be used often here. Generating the field tensor F in the Lorenz gauge starting from the gauge- invariant from involves swapping the fields in the following way: This looks more complicated than it is. The first term of the generator involves the scalar field only, (phi, 0), and the second term involves the 3-vector field only, (0, A). The field tensor F in the Coulomb gauge is generated by subtracting away the divergence of A, which explains why the second and third terms involve only A, even though Del.A is zero :-) The field tensor F in the temporal gauge is quite similar to the Coulomb gauge, but some of the signs have changed to target the dphi/dt term. What is the simplest expression that all of these generator share? I call it the field tensor F in the light gauge: The light gauge is one sign different from the Lorenz gauge, but its generator is a simple as it gets. Implications In the quaternion representation, the gauge is a scalar generated in such a way as to not alter the 3-vector. In a lists of gauges in graduate-level quantum field theory written by Kaku, the light gauge did not make the list of the top 6 gauges. There is a reason for this. Gauges are presented as a choice for a physicist to make. The most interesting gauges have to do with a long-running popularity contest. The relationship between gauges is guessed, not written explicitly as was done here. The term that did not make the cut stands out.

The field tensor F in the Coulomb gauge is generated by subtracting away the divergence of A, which explains why the second and third terms involve only A, even though Del.A is zero :-) The field tensor F in the temporal gauge is quite similar to the Coulomb gauge, but some of the signs have changed to target the dphi/dt term. What is the simplest expression that all of these generator share? I call it the field tensor F in the light gauge: The light gauge is one sign different from the Lorenz gauge, but its generator is a simple as it gets.","title":"The Field Tensor F in Different Gauges"},{"location":"EM/gauges/#implications","text":"In the quaternion representation, the gauge is a scalar generated in such a way as to not alter the 3-vector.

B. Sweetser March 31, 2015 *Essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2015 Awards for Essays on Gravitation 39 Drummer Road, Acton, MA 01720 sweetser@alum.mit.edu Abstract The square of a quaternion luckily has the Lorentz invariant interval of special relativity as its first term. The other three space-times-time terms are commonly ignored. Ways to vary a quaternion with a continuous function that leave the intraval in the square invariant are discussed. One method uses exponentials, leading to the hyperbolic functions found useful in special relativity. Using the same approach to keep the space-times-time invariantleads to a dynamic interval term. By preserving the space-times-time terms using an exponential function and the geometric source mass, an interval term is found that is similar but experimentally distinct from the Schwarzschild metric applied to space-time 4-vectors. Space-times-time invariance is not a field theory, so gravitons are not necessary and quantization is moot. General relativity, Einstein's elegant theory of gravity, is a field theory like the three other fundamental forces of Nature: electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force. The cause of gravity is any form of energy or momentum. The field equations dictate the motion of particles with energy, thus applying to all particles, even light. Special relativity is not a special case of general relativity, despite the name. Special relativity is about an invariant quantity in Nature that all inertial observers agree upon: the interval, a difference of squares in measurements of space and time. Special relativity applies to all measurements, even those involving the fundamental forces. The product of a measurement in space and one in time, referred to hereafter as space-times- time, will change in known ways for different inertial observers. 1 This essay explores the opposite situation: what if two observers find their space-times-time was an invariant, but their intervals were different? It is suggestive that a defining characteristic of general relativity is that intervals vary at different places in a gravitational field. The invariant interval of special relativity in flat spacetime is generated by contracting a 4-vector using the Minkowski metric. With such a simple system, other products are omitted, namely, any with the space-times-time form, dtdxi. Such terms could appear if one used a metric with non-diagonal components which are unnecessary for flat spacetime. There is a type of math that naturally embraces space-times-time terms. All are familiar with real numbers, a mathematical field that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The complex numbers are also a mathematical field, but now one has two degrees of freedom, often represented by a pair of numbers. 2 Complex numbers are no longer a totally ordered set. The next sort of numbers has four-part harmonies, with a real bass and three imaginary tenors. Known as the quaternions, they do not commute, so live with the label of a division algebra. Quaternions still retain addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The rules are similar for the complex numbers, with the imaginary i replaced by an imaginary 3-vector and the inclusion of the anti-symmetric cross product. Quaternions play a minor technical role as the best way to do rotations in three dimensions.[8] A unit quaternion SU(2) sits in the center of the standard model gauge symmetries. Despite that central role, quaternions have historically been vilified to a comic degree. \"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way, including Maxwell.\" Lord Kelvin[10, See vol. II, p. 1070.] There are published claims that one cannot write the Maxwell equations or represent the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions.[2, 4, 6, 9] Neither happens to be true. See the appendix for details if interested. The square of a space-time measurement represented with quaternions is: The first term of the square is the Lorentz invariant interval. It is followed by the three space-times-time terms. There are a few advantages to having these three extra bits of information. Say two inertial observers Alice and Bob saw a collection of events. The first term of the square of the quaternion would be the same. An analysis of the space-times-time value would let us know how Alice was moving relative to Bob. If they also calculate the product of two different events in both orders, then we would know something about the angle between the events and the observer. If ab = ba, then they are in a straight line. If for the three space-times-time terms, ab = -ba , they are at a right angle. Anything between those extremes is in between. What happens in curved space-time? With the standard machinery of differential geometry, a simple subtraction is not allowed. Instead, one has to parallel transport one event to another along a geodesic using a known connection. Then the subtraction can be done properly. Quaternions don't have a metric. Without a metric, there is no connection. Maybe quaternions are an \"unmixed evil.\" Let's explore anyway. Construct a quaternion out of space-time functions that can be varied, yet the first term of the square is invariant as required by special relativity: If the function f was exactly the same as each normalized gi, then the first term in the square, the interval, would always be zero. 3 This is an important case: it is light. Changes in time are exactly equal to the magnitude of changes in space. With zero covered, find a way so the first term in the square is equal to one for all inertial observers. The square of f must cancel out the square of g, but leave unity behind. Work with a third function h and its inverse: So long as the function h has an inverse, this will always work. 4 Exponential functions play an important role in theoretical physics. If the exponent is zero, unity is the result and nothing is changed. For tiny exponents, the result may contain a simple harmonic oscillator which are ubiquitous in Nature. For the case in hand, the function f is a hyperbolic cosine which is the stretch factor gamma of special relativity. The function g is the hyperbolic sine, the gamma beta factor that also appears in special relativity. Repeat these two simple math exercises for space-times-time. Find a general way to make the square of a measurement have either three zeroes or three ones - times the factor of two that is from the sum of two identical terms. Generating three zero space-times-time factors is easy: take the norm of any quaternion. Some effort has gone into quantum mechanics that uses quaternions in place of complex numbers.[1] That topic is beyond the scope of this short essay. The general way to generate three factors of two is also not difficult: An exponential function could be plugged in as before. This moves from a pure math exercise to one with physics content if the exponential is chosen to be related to gravity by using the geometric length of a mass 5 : Let's pause to discuss this expression. No metric was used to get here. No field equation was solved. Instead a new invariance of Nature has been proposed as it applies to products of quaternions in a weak gravitational system characterized by one length. Algebraically, the first term is the same as the Rosen exponential metric applied to an event 4-vector.[7] Experimental tests of weak gravity fields use the first three terms of the Taylor series expansion in z for the change in time, and the first two for changes in space. Those terms are identical for the space-times-time invariant expression and the Schwarzschild metric in Cartesian coordinates. There is no way to distinguish these two at what is called first-order Parameterized Post- Newtonian (PPN) accuracy. At second order, the new invariance proposal predicts 6% more bending of light around a gravitational source.[3] Since the effect is smaller than a micro-arcsecond, that is beyond our reach today. Massless light is bent by gravity. That can be accounted for in general relativity because the coupling is to energy density which light has. With the space-times-time invariance, there is no coupling term nor any field equations. The same thing happens in special relativity: there is no coupling, nor field equations. The space-times-time invariance may be the correct variation on the invariant interval of special relativity, thus being the simplest pure geometry approach to gravity, but not too simple. With no graviton to quantize, there is no issue of quantizing a gravitational field. What about energy loss by a binary pulsar? The Rosen metric allows for a dipole mode of gravity wave emission, so is ruled out by the data which requires a lower rate of gravity wave emissions.[11, See section 12.3(b).] In the space-times-time invariant proposal, the exponential function and its inverse applied to gravity above was static. Make it dynamic by including a time factor in a way consistent with how we see the metric change in time for a binary pulsar. Is a graviton required to carry away the energy? The system in question is an isolated binary pulsar that conserves both energy and momentum. It does not have a dipole moment like a magnet, but does have a quadruple moment, like a wobbling water balloon. The energy could be carried away by an electromagnetic field that had a quadruple as its lowest moment. While unusual, it is possible. Does gravity as a space-times-time invariance play nicely with the three other fundamental forces of physics? Given the stellar record of special relativity, there is reason to hope. Appendix: Maxwell equations and the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions The homogeneous Maxwell equations are vector identities. They hold when written using quaternions. The Lagrange density used to derive the Maxwell source equations is the difference of the squared magnetic and electric fields[5]: The difference of two squares is the product of their sums and difference. The simplest product of a quaternion differential operator and potential generates the difference of the magnetic and electric fields: This also has a gauge field g which can easily be eliminated by subtracting the conjugate of this product. The sum of these two fields - times a factor of minus one - is formed by reversing the order of the differential with the potential: The first term drops into the Euler-Lagrange equations to generate the Gauss and Ampere laws of electromagnetism. As a bonus, there is the Poynting vector, the directional energy flux density of an electromagnetic field. Representing the compact Lie group needed to do spatial rotations is itself compact when using quaternions: If one tries to simply change from the cosine and sine function to the hyperbolic cosine and sine function, a member of the Lorentz group is not generated. This should not be a surprise since that group is not compact, a non-trivial change. Other terms are required to pull off the trick: Quaternions provide another way to write these expressions. Nothing new is learned, other than to be skeptical of claims about the limitations of quaternions. Bibliography [1] S. L. Adler. Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.

B. Sweetser March 31, 2015 *Essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2015 Awards for Essays on Gravitation 39 Drummer Road, Acton, MA 01720 sweetser@alum.mit.edu Abstract The square of a quaternion luckily has the Lorentz invariant interval of special relativity as its first term. The other three space-times-time terms are commonly ignored. Ways to vary a quaternion with a continuous function that leave the intraval in the square invariant are discussed. One method uses exponentials, leading to the hyperbolic functions found useful in special relativity. Using the same approach to keep the space-times-time invariantleads to a dynamic interval term. By preserving the space-times-time terms using an exponential function and the geometric source mass, an interval term is found that is similar but experimentally distinct from the Schwarzschild metric applied to space-time 4-vectors. Space-times-time invariance is not a field theory, so gravitons are not necessary and quantization is moot. General relativity, Einstein's elegant theory of gravity, is a field theory like the three other fundamental forces of Nature: electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force. The cause of gravity is any form of energy or momentum. The field equations dictate the motion of particles with energy, thus applying to all particles, even light. Special relativity is not a special case of general relativity, despite the name. Special relativity is about an invariant quantity in Nature that all inertial observers agree upon: the interval, a difference of squares in measurements of space and time. Special relativity applies to all measurements, even those involving the fundamental forces. The product of a measurement in space and one in time, referred to hereafter as space-times- time, will change in known ways for different inertial observers. 1 This essay explores the opposite situation: what if two observers find their space-times-time was an invariant, but their intervals were different? It is suggestive that a defining characteristic of general relativity is that intervals vary at different places in a gravitational field. The invariant interval of special relativity in flat spacetime is generated by contracting a 4-vector using the Minkowski metric. With such a simple system, other products are omitted, namely, any with the space-times-time form, dtdxi. Such terms could appear if one used a metric with non-diagonal components which are unnecessary for flat spacetime. There is a type of math that naturally embraces space-times-time terms. All are familiar with real numbers, a mathematical field that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The complex numbers are also a mathematical field, but now one has two degrees of freedom, often represented by a pair of numbers. 2 Complex numbers are no longer a totally ordered set. The next sort of numbers has four-part harmonies, with a real bass and three imaginary tenors. Known as the quaternions, they do not commute, so live with the label of a division algebra. Quaternions still retain addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The rules are similar for the complex numbers, with the imaginary i replaced by an imaginary 3-vector and the inclusion of the anti-symmetric cross product. Quaternions play a minor technical role as the best way to do rotations in three dimensions.[8] A unit quaternion SU(2) sits in the center of the standard model gauge symmetries. Despite that central role, quaternions have historically been vilified to a comic degree. \"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way, including Maxwell.\" Lord Kelvin[10, See vol. II, p. 1070.] There are published claims that one cannot write the Maxwell equations or represent the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions.[2, 4, 6, 9] Neither happens to be true. See the appendix for details if interested. The square of a space-time measurement represented with quaternions is: The first term of the square is the Lorentz invariant interval. It is followed by the three space-times-time terms. There are a few advantages to having these three extra bits of information. Say two inertial observers Alice and Bob saw a collection of events. The first term of the square of the quaternion would be the same. An analysis of the space-times-time value would let us know how Alice was moving relative to Bob. If they also calculate the product of two different events in both orders, then we would know something about the angle between the events and the observer. If ab = ba, then they are in a straight line. If for the three space-times-time terms, ab = -ba , they are at a right angle. Anything between those extremes is in between. What happens in curved space-time? With the standard machinery of differential geometry, a simple subtraction is not allowed. Instead, one has to parallel transport one event to another along a geodesic using a known connection. Then the subtraction can be done properly. Quaternions don't have a metric. Without a metric, there is no connection. Maybe quaternions are an \"unmixed evil.\" Let's explore anyway. Construct a quaternion out of space-time functions that can be varied, yet the first term of the square is invariant as required by special relativity: If the function f was exactly the same as each normalized gi, then the first term in the square, the interval, would always be zero. 3 This is an important case: it is light. Changes in time are exactly equal to the magnitude of changes in space. With zero covered, find a way so the first term in the square is equal to one for all inertial observers. The square of f must cancel out the square of g, but leave unity behind. Work with a third function h and its inverse: So long as the function h has an inverse, this will always work. 4 Exponential functions play an important role in theoretical physics. If the exponent is zero, unity is the result and nothing is changed. For tiny exponents, the result may contain a simple harmonic oscillator which are ubiquitous in Nature. For the case in hand, the function f is a hyperbolic cosine which is the stretch factor gamma of special relativity. The function g is the hyperbolic sine, the gamma beta factor that also appears in special relativity. Repeat these two simple math exercises for space-times-time. Find a general way to make the square of a measurement have either three zeroes or three ones - times the factor of two that is from the sum of two identical terms. Generating three zero space-times-time factors is easy: take the norm of any quaternion. Some effort has gone into quantum mechanics that uses quaternions in place of complex numbers.[1] That topic is beyond the scope of this short essay. The general way to generate three factors of two is also not difficult: An exponential function could be plugged in as before. This moves from a pure math exercise to one with physics content if the exponential is chosen to be related to gravity by using the geometric length of a mass 5 : Let's pause to discuss this expression. No metric was used to get here. No field equation was solved. Instead a new invariance of Nature has been proposed as it applies to products of quaternions in a weak gravitational system characterized by one length. Algebraically, the first term is the same as the Rosen exponential metric applied to an event 4-vector.[7] Experimental tests of weak gravity fields use the first three terms of the Taylor series expansion in z for the change in time, and the first two for changes in space. Those terms are identical for the space-times-time invariant expression and the Schwarzschild metric in Cartesian coordinates. There is no way to distinguish these two at what is called first-order Parameterized Post- Newtonian (PPN) accuracy. At second order, the new invariance proposal predicts 6% more bending of light around a gravitational source.[3] Since the effect is smaller than a micro-arcsecond, that is beyond our reach today. Massless light is bent by gravity. That can be accounted for in general relativity because the coupling is to energy density which light has. With the space-times-time invariance, there is no coupling term nor any field equations. The same thing happens in special relativity: there is no coupling, nor field equations. The space-times-time invariance may be the correct variation on the invariant interval of special relativity, thus being the simplest pure geometry approach to gravity, but not too simple. With no graviton to quantize, there is no issue of quantizing a gravitational field. What about energy loss by a binary pulsar? The Rosen metric allows for a dipole mode of gravity wave emission, so is ruled out by the data which requires a lower rate of gravity wave emissions.[11, See section 12.3(b).] In the space-times-time invariant proposal, the exponential function and its inverse applied to gravity above was static. Make it dynamic by including a time factor in a way consistent with how we see the metric change in time for a binary pulsar. Is a graviton required to carry away the energy? The system in question is an isolated binary pulsar that conserves both energy and momentum. It does not have a dipole moment like a magnet, but does have a quadruple moment, like a wobbling water balloon. The energy could be carried away by an electromagnetic field that had a quadruple as its lowest moment. While unusual, it is possible. Does gravity as a space-times-time invariance play nicely with the three other fundamental forces of physics? Given the stellar record of special relativity, there is reason to hope. Appendix: Maxwell equations and the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions The homogeneous Maxwell equations are vector identities. They hold when written using quaternions. The Lagrange density used to derive the Maxwell source equations is the difference of the squared magnetic and electric fields[5]: The difference of two squares is the product of their sums and difference. The simplest product of a quaternion differential operator and potential generates the difference of the magnetic and electric fields: This also has a gauge field g which can easily be eliminated by subtracting the conjugate of this product. The sum of these two fields - times a factor of minus one - is formed by reversing the order of the differential with the potential: The first term drops into the Euler-Lagrange equations to generate the Gauss and Ampere laws of electromagnetism. As a bonus, there is the Poynting vector, the directional energy flux density of an electromagnetic field. Representing the compact Lie group needed to do spatial rotations is itself compact when using quaternions: If one tries to simply change from the cosine and sine function to the hyperbolic cosine and sine function, a member of the Lorentz group is not generated. This should not be a surprise since that group is not compact, a non-trivial change. Other terms are required to pull off the trick: Quaternions provide another way to write these expressions. Nothing new is learned, other than to be skeptical of claims about the limitations of quaternions. Bibliography [1] S. L. Adler. Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.

My hypothesis is that complex analysis should be self-evident within the structure of quaternion analysis. The challenge is to define the derivative in a non-singular way, so that a left derivative always equals a right derivative. If quaternions would only commute... Well, the scalar part of a quaternion does commute. If, in the limit, the differential element converged to a scalar, then it would commute. This idea can be defined precisely. All that is required is that the magnitude of the vector goes to zero faster than the scalar. This might initially appears as an unreasonable constraint. However, there is an important application in physics. Consider a set of quaternions that represent events in spacetime. If the magnitude of the 3-space vector is less than the time scalar, events are separated by a timelike interval. It requires a speed less than the speed of light to connect the events. This is true no matter what coordinate system is chosen. Defining a Quaternion A quaternion has 4 degrees of freedom, so it needs 4 real-valued variables to be defined: Imagine we want to do a simple binary operation such as subtraction, without having to specify the coordinate system chosen. Subtraction will only work if the coordinate systems are the same, whether it is Cartesian, spherical or otherwise. Let e0, e1, e2, and e3 be the shared, but unspecified, basis. Now we can define the difference between two quaternion q and q' that is independent of the coordinate system used for the measurement. What is unusual about this definition are the factors of a third. They will be necessary later in order to define a holonomic equation later in this section. Hamilton gave each element parity with the others, a very reasonable approach. I have found that it is important to give the scalar and the sum of the 3-vector parity. Without this \"scale\" factor on the 3-vector, change in the scalar is not given its proper weight. If dq is squared, the scalar part of the resulting quaternion forms a metric. What should the connection be between the squares of the basis vectors? The amount of intrinsic curvature should be equal, so that a transformation between two basis 3-vectors does not contain a hidden bump. Should time be treated exactly like space? The Schwarzschild metric of general relativity suggests otherwise. Let e1, e2, and e3 form an independent, dimensionless, orthogonal basis for the 3-vector such that: This unusual relationship between the basis vectors is consistent with Hamilton's choice of 1, i, j, k if e0 2 = 1. For that case, calculate the square of dq: The scalar part is known in physics as the Minkowski interval between two events in flat spacetime. If e0 2 does not equal one, then the metric would apply to a non-flat spacetime. A metric that has been measured experimentally is the Schwarzchild metric of general relativity. Set e0 2 = (1 - 2 GM/c 2 R), and calculate the square of dq: This is the Schwarzchild metric of general relativity. Notice that the 3-vector is unchanged (this may be a defining characteristic). There are very few opportunities for freedom in basic mathematical definitions. I have chosen this unusual relationships between the squares of the basis vectors to make a result from physics easy to express. Physics guides my choices in mathematical definitions :-) An Automorphic Basis for Quaternion Analysis A quaternion has 4 degrees of freedom. To completely specify a quaternion function, it must also have four degrees of freedom. Three other linearly- independent variables involving q can be defined using conjugates combined with rotations: The conjugate as it is usually defined (q * ) flips the sign of all but the scalar. The q *1 flips the signs of all but the e1 term, and q *2 all but the e2 term. The set q, q * , q *1 , q *2 form the basis for quaternion analysis. The conjugate of a conjugate should give back the original quaternion. Something subtle but perhaps directly related to spin happens looking at how the conjugates effect products: The conjugate applied to a product brings the result directly back to the reverse order of the elements. The first and second conjugates point things in exactly the opposite way. The property of going \"half way around\" is reminiscent of spin. A tighter link will need to be examined. Future Timelike Derivative Instead of the standard approach to quaternion analysis which focuses on left versus right derivatives, I concentrate on the ratio of scalars to 3-vectors. This is natural when thinking about the structure of Minkowski spacetime, where the ratio of the change in time to the change in 3-space defines five separate regions: timelike past, timelike future, lightlike past, lightlike future, and spacelike. There are no continuous Lorentz transformations to link these regions. Each region will require a separate definition of the derivative, and they will each have distinct properties. I will start with the simplest case, and look at a series of examples in detail. Definition: The future timelike derivative: Consider a covariant quaternion function f with a domain of H and a range of H. A future timelike derivative to be defined, the 3-vector must approach zero faster than the positive scalar. If this is not the case, then this definition cannot be used. Implementing these requirements involves two limit processes applied sequentially to a differential quaternion D. First the limit of the three vector is taken as it goes to zero, (D - D * )/2 -> 0. Second, the limit of the scalar is taken, (D + D * )/2 -> +0 (the plus zero indicates that it must be approached with a time greater than zero, in other words, from the future). The net effect of these two limit processes is that D->0. The definition is invariant under a passive transformation of the basis. The 4 real variables a0, a1, a2, a3 can be represented by functions using the conjugates as a basis. Begin with a simple example: The definition gives the expected result. A simple approach to a trickier example: So far, the fancy double limit process has been irrelevant for these identity functions, because the differential element has been eliminated. That changes with the following example, a tricky approach to the same result. Because the 3-vector goes to zero faster than the scalar for the differential element, after the first limit process, the remaining differential is a scalar so it commutes with any quaternion. This is what is required to dance around the e1 and lead to the cancellation. The initial hypothesis was that complex analysis should be a self-evident subset of quaternion analysis. So this quaternion derivative should match up with the complex case, which is: These are the same result up to two subedits. Quaternions have three imaginary axes, which creates the factor of three. The conjugate of a complex number is really doing the work of the first quaternion conjugate q *1 (which equals -z * ), because z * flips the sign of the first 3-vector component, but no others. The derivative of a quaternion applies equally well to polynomials. This is the expected result for this polynomial. It would be straightforward to show that all polynomials gave the expected results. Mathematicians might be concerned by this result, because if the 3-vector D goes to -D nothing will change about the quaternion derivative. This is actually consistent with principles of special relativity. For timelike separated events, right and left depend on the inertial reference frame, so a timelike derivative should not depend on the direction of the 3-vector. Analytic Functions There are 4 types of quaternion derivatives and 4 component functions. The following table describes the 16 derivatives for this set This table will be used extensively to evaluate if a function is analytic using the chain rule. Let's see if the identity function w = q is analytic. Use the chain rule to calculate the derivative will respect to each term: Use combinations of these terms to calculate the four quaternion derivatives using the chain rule. This has the derivatives expected if w=q is analytic in q. Another test involves the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The presence of the three basis vectors changes things slightly. This also solves a holonomic equation. There are no off diagonal terms to compare. This exercise can be repeated for the other identity functions. One noticeable change is that the role that the conjugate must play. Consider the identity function w = q *1 . To show that this is analytic in q *1 requires that one always works with basis vectors of the q *1 variety. This also solves a first conjugate holonomic equation. Power functions can be analyzed in exactly the same way: This time there are cross terms involved. At first glance, one might think these are incorrect, since the signs of the derivatives are suppose to be opposite. Actually they are, but it is hidden in an accounting trick :-) For example, the derivative of u with respect to a1 has a factor of e1 2 , which makes it negative. The derivative of the first component of V with respect to a0 is positive. Keeping all the information about signs in the e's makes things look non-standard, but they are not. Note that these are three scalar equalities. The other Cauchy-Riemann equations evaluate to a single 3-vector equation. This represents four constraints on the four degrees of freedom found in quaternions to find out if a function happens to be analytic. This also solves a holonomic equation. Since power series can be analytic, this should open the door to all forms of analysis. (I have done the case for the cube of q, and it too is analytic in q). 4 Other Derivatives So far, this work has only involved future timelike derivatives. There are five other regions of spacetime to cover. The simplest next case is for past timelike derivatives. The only change is in the limit, where the scalar approaches zero from below. This will make many derivatives look time symmetric, which is the case for most laws of physics. A more complicated case involves spacelike derivatives. In the spacelike region, changes in time go to zero faster than the absolute value of the 3-vector. Therefore the order of the limit processes is reversed. This time the scalar approaches zero, then the 3-vector. This creates a problem, because after the first limit process, the differential element is (0, D), which will not commute with most quaternions. That will lead to the differential element not cancelling. The way around this is to take its norm, which is a scalar. A spacelike differential element is defined by taking the ratio of a differential quaternion element D to its 3-vector, D - D * . Let the norm of D approach zero. To be defined, the three vector must approach zero faster than its corresponding scalar. To make the definition non-singular everywhere, multiply by the conjugate. In the limit D D * /((D - D * )(D - D * ))* approaches (1, 0), a scalar. To make this concrete, consider a simple example, f = q^2. Apply the definition: The second and fifth terms are unitary rotations of the 3-vector B. Since the differential element D could be pointed anywhere, this is an arbitrary rotation. Define: Substitute, and continue: Look at how wonderfully strange this is! The arbitrary rotation of the 3-vector B means that this derivative is bound by an inequality. If D is in direction of B, then it will be an equality, but D could also be in the opposite direction, leading to a destruction of a contribution from the 3-vector. The spacelike derivative can therefore interfere with itself. This is quite a natural thing to do in quantum mechanics. The spacelike derivative is positive definite, and could be used to define a Banach space. Defining the lightlike derivative, where the change in time is equal to the change in space, will require more study. It may turn out that this derivative is singular everywhere, but it will require some skill to find a technically viable compromise between the spacelike and timelike derivative to synthesis the lightlike derivative.","title":"Quaternion Analysis"},{"location":"Math/analysis.book/#quaternion-analysis","text":"Complex numbers are a subfield of quaternions.

I will start with the simplest case, and look at a series of examples in detail. Definition: The future timelike derivative: Consider a covariant quaternion function f with a domain of H and a range of H. A future timelike derivative to be defined, the 3-vector must approach zero faster than the positive scalar. If this is not the case, then this definition cannot be used. Implementing these requirements involves two limit processes applied sequentially to a differential quaternion D. First the limit of the three vector is taken as it goes to zero, (D - D * )/2 -> 0. Second, the limit of the scalar is taken, (D + D * )/2 -> +0 (the plus zero indicates that it must be approached with a time greater than zero, in other words, from the future). The net effect of these two limit processes is that D->0. The definition is invariant under a passive transformation of the basis. The 4 real variables a0, a1, a2, a3 can be represented by functions using the conjugates as a basis. Begin with a simple example: The definition gives the expected result. A simple approach to a trickier example: So far, the fancy double limit process has been irrelevant for these identity functions, because the differential element has been eliminated. That changes with the following example, a tricky approach to the same result. Because the 3-vector goes to zero faster than the scalar for the differential element, after the first limit process, the remaining differential is a scalar so it commutes with any quaternion. This is what is required to dance around the e1 and lead to the cancellation. The initial hypothesis was that complex analysis should be a self-evident subset of quaternion analysis. So this quaternion derivative should match up with the complex case, which is: These are the same result up to two subedits. Quaternions have three imaginary axes, which creates the factor of three. The conjugate of a complex number is really doing the work of the first quaternion conjugate q *1 (which equals -z * ), because z * flips the sign of the first 3-vector component, but no others. The derivative of a quaternion applies equally well to polynomials. This is the expected result for this polynomial. It would be straightforward to show that all polynomials gave the expected results. Mathematicians might be concerned by this result, because if the 3-vector D goes to -D nothing will change about the quaternion derivative.

This has the derivatives expected if w=q is analytic in q. Another test involves the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The presence of the three basis vectors changes things slightly. This also solves a holonomic equation. There are no off diagonal terms to compare. This exercise can be repeated for the other identity functions. One noticeable change is that the role that the conjugate must play. Consider the identity function w = q *1 . To show that this is analytic in q *1 requires that one always works with basis vectors of the q *1 variety. This also solves a first conjugate holonomic equation. Power functions can be analyzed in exactly the same way: This time there are cross terms involved. At first glance, one might think these are incorrect, since the signs of the derivatives are suppose to be opposite. Actually they are, but it is hidden in an accounting trick :-) For example, the derivative of u with respect to a1 has a factor of e 1 2 , which makes it negative. The derivative of the first component of V with respect to a0 is positive. Keeping all the information about signs in the e's makes things look non-standard, but they are not. Note that these are three scalar equalities. The other Cauchy-Riemann equations evaluate to a single 3-vector equation. This represents four constraints on the four degrees of freedom found in quaternions to find out if a function happens to be analytic. This also solves a holonomic equation. Since power series can be analytic, this should open the door to all forms of analysis. (I have done the case for the cube of q, and it too is analytic in q).","title":"Analytic Functions"},{"location":"Math/analysis/#4-other-derivatives","text":"So far, this work has only involved future timelike derivatives. There are five other regions of spacetime to cover. The simplest next case is for past timelike derivatives. The only change is in the limit, where the scalar approaches zero from below. This will make many derivatives look time symmetric, which is the case for most laws of physics. A more complicated case involves spacelike derivatives. In the spacelike region, changes in time go to zero faster than the absolute value of the 3-vector. Therefore the order of the limit processes is reversed. This time the scalar approaches zero, then the 3-vector. This creates a problem, because after the first limit process, the differential element is (0, D), which will not commute with most quaternions. That will lead to the differential element not cancelling. The way around this is to take its norm, which is a scalar. A spacelike differential element is defined by taking the ratio of a differential quaternion element D to its 3-vector, D - D * . Let the norm of D approach zero. To be defined, the three vector must approach zero faster than its corresponding scalar. To make the definition non-singular everywhere, multiply by the conjugate. In the limit D D * /((D - D * )(D - D * ))* approaches (1, 0), a scalar. To make this concrete, consider a simple example, f = q^2. Apply the definition: The second and fifth terms are unitary rotations of the 3-vector B. Since the differential element D could be pointed anywhere, this is an arbitrary rotation. Define: Substitute, and continue: Look at how wonderfully strange this is! The arbitrary rotation of the 3-vector B means that this derivative is bound by an inequality. If D is in direction of B, then it will be an equality, but D could also be in the opposite direction, leading to a destruction of a contribution from the 3-vector. The spacelike derivative can therefore interfere with itself. This is quite a natural thing to do in quantum mechanics. The spacelike derivative is positive definite, and could be used to define a Banach space. Defining the lightlike derivative, where the change in time is equal to the change in space, will require more study. It may turn out that this derivative is singular everywhere, but it will require some skill to find a technically viable compromise between the spacelike and timelike derivative to synthesis the lightlike derivative.","title":"4 Other Derivatives"},{"location":"Math/complex_quaternions/","text":"Really Complex Quaternions What is a quaternion? Mathematicians might claim it was the independent inventions of Gauss, Hamilton, and Rodrigues. Unit quaternions are useful to do 3D rotations and as an esteemed member of the standard model. They are also one of many Clifford algebras, Cl (0, 2) being its formal name. In this essay, the physics of space-time will drive the discussion, not accidents of history. The words for real and imaginary numbers arose from a catfight between mathematicians over complex numbers. The labels I will use always have to be tied to space-time. Please consider this odd constraint a playful way to think differently about numbers for physics The method for constructing quaternions with the roots in space-time will start with discrete groups. A discrete group can be made continuous. The theory of Lie groups provides the background for such a process. Physics is about stuff in motion. With both \"stuff\" and \"motion\" broadly defined, animations will be provided. I will detail the rules for addition, multiplication, and animations for 0, the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. Going into this much detail requires my longest essay ever. To provide an overview, here is one image with the information: In this essay we will discuss each area to understand the logic of numbers Nature may use to account for everything. Zero, One, and the Positive Real Numbers Start with the trivial group. It has one member, call it the identity element e, so the entire set is {e}. Mathematicians have provided a horrible label for this group since it sounds unworthy of careful consideration. I was going to do the same until I thought about how I was going to make a short film of this discrete group. It is the shortest of all possible films, lasting exactly one frame. I talked with the cinematographer, the lighting director, and the artistic director about the shoot: they all thought it would be easy. The key grip interrupted my mumbling to myself to ask what we were going to take a picture of? The math consultant on the set said anything and everything can be considered a way to represent the trivial group. The permutation operator, call it p , means epe=e . The permutation operator works on any number or object to be found in the Universe. Making a one frame film about everything did not sound practical. I remembered Peano's work where he built number theory up from 0 and 1. I will focus on two operators, addition and multiplication, because together those are needed to make a mathematical field. A mathematical field in turn is the ground floor needed for calculus, the study of change in space-time. With representation theory, one makes an abstract group concrete. For the two sets of number {0} and {1} and the two operators addition and multiplication, one can represent the trivial group with ({0}, +), ({0}, x), and ({1}, x) but not ({1}, +). Here is a way to view the topology, how numbers are connected. Downright trivial, as expected. There is only one thing, the black cube on a black background. This image will get more complicated as new numbers are examined. The multiplication operator allows us to use either of the binary buddies to represent the trivial group. Here are the 4 needed qualities for e =1: There is closure: 1 x 1 = 1 There is an identity: 1 There is an inverse element in the group: 1 The operations are associative: (1 x 1) x 1 = 1 x (1 x 1) The same can be done for e =0: There is closure: 0 x 0 = 0 There is an identity: 0 There is an inverse element in the group: 0 The operations are associative: (0 x 0) x 0 = 0 x (0 x 0) Notice I was careful not to talk about division. The operator is multiplication and the set needs an inverse of multiplication. The set has one element, and that element happens to be its own inverse with the multiplication operator. There is a good reason to never mention subtraction or division as operators. Neither of them is associative: ( a - b ) - c != a - ( b - c ) ( a / b ) / c != a / ( b / c ) These two operators are so ingrained in me, it is hard to part with them, but I will do it for the sake of associativity and group theory :-) Below is the product table, describing all possible multiplication products: Trivial again because e x e = e . The same information can be presented with graph theory, where the cubes are vertices and the edges are the multipliers: The vertex in the graph is the cube, the edge is the pipe cleaner. The rule for multiplication is vertex times an edge goes to a vertex. In this simple case, the edge makes a loop. I also included a white straw as a way to represent the continuous version of the e =1 trivial group. Recall one of the fundamental differences between zero and one under multiplication: n x 1 = n n x 0 = 0 Think of the message these two simple equations tell. In the first case any number gets to stay just like themselves. In the second case, the number must become like 0. This is a source of tension in these two ways to represent the trivial group with the multiplication operator. Try to make the trivial group cover more ground by using the set of positive real numbers that do not have zero, R + \\{0}. A continuous group is formed by multiplying the trivial group represented by e =1 times every element in the infinite set R + \\{0}. Each element in this continuous group will have a multiplicative inverse. This part of the story is exclusively about multiplication. Repeat this process exactly as before except to use e =0 as the representative of the trivial group. Zero times the positive reals without zero always generates a zero. The group remains trivial, having only one member. I don't want to go overboard with the following claim, but it is the kind of thing that makes thinking about physics interesting while I walk around. One profound mystery in physics is how processes can be discrete as well as continuous, the proverbial wave/particle duality. It would be cool if the root of this mystery was an appreciation of the trivial group. The Trivial Film Here is the one frame trivial film represented by e =0: In space-time, now ( e =0) goes on and on forever. The idea that this one frame animation would last a billion years struck me as odd initially. Yet \"now\" is something that is always in space-time without anyone's intervention. Now requires no energy. I don't think I can honestly make an animation of the trivial group represented by e =1, or its continuous extension R + \\{0}. The problem is with start of the film. It necessarily is in the future. Because zero is explicitly excluded, there is no now to start the film to then see what the future looks like based on a math model. Is the trivial group a mathematical field? It is time for me to open \"Principles of Mathematical Analysis\" by Rudin and turn to page 5. One needs both addition and multiplication to have group properties. Check. The distributive law must also hold. Check. All three of these work in the case for e =0. There is a stipulation (M4) that the multiplicative inverse is not equal to the additive inverse. Therefore the trivial group is not a mathematical field. I will define something called the trivial mathematical field. It has every rule set out in Rudin without the requirement that the additive inverse be distinct from the multiplicative one. The trivial group represented by the set {0} and the addition and multiplication operators forms a trivial mathematical field. The trivial group represented by the set {1} and multiplication is not a trivial mathematical field. Some might complain that the trivial mathematical field is beyond dull. I argue that change can only be understood against a backdrop that has no capacity to change. It is the canvas for change. \"Now\" is an unchanging quality of the Universe. I sometime call it the observer where the observer is as passive as can be imagined. By contrast, I think of one as a signal in space-time. The trivial group will be there in all subsequent discussions of the real numbers, the complex numbers, and quaternions. The tension between zero/now/observer and one/signal will remain. The Real Numbers Start by understanding the rules for multiplication that require the abelian cyclic group Z 2 , also known as the sign group. Here is the product table: In practice, the way to use a product table is to pick one value from the first column then multiply it by something from the top row to get the result from where they meet in the table. So e x e = e which is the trivial group product discussed in the previous section and e x i 2 = i 2 . Because the off diagonal elements are symmetric, the group is abelian, meaning the order of multiplication does not matter. The labels one uses for the product table (the e and i 2 ) don't matter unless one wants to tell a longer, logically consistent story. Since I have to pass through complex numbers on the way to quaternions, the i 2 will be helpful. The folks at groupprops.subwiki.org use x, but -1 is common. To be honest, I use -1 to check I did things right. Graph theory can be used to communicate the same information: The vertices are the cubes, the edges are the pipe cleaners. The trivial group represented by e =0 in black is here. The trivial group represented by e =1 is here too. The gray cube with the white loop is not the trivial group since it involves both e and i 2 . The four products in the product table should be easy to find in the graph. If the information is exactly the same, why present both the product table and graph? The reason is biological: language is processed in a different part of the brain that the visuals (which happens against the back wall of the skull). More processing power is built into visual analysis, so it would be good to have a precise visual representation of these ideas. It is common practice to not include the white loops. I am consistently against dropping \"obvious\" information. Explicit trumps implicit. The gray pipe cleaner is bi-directional because the vertex e times i 2 gets to the i 2 vertex, while i 2 times i 2 returns to e . While the discrete groups may help us understand multiplication, to get closure with addition we often need infinite sets. Start with a discrete example: e + i 2 = 0 The astute reader will notice how this expression needs both possible representations for the trivial group: e =0 and e =1, the additive and multiplicative identities respectively. It is the multiplicative identity that can be used to cover all the real numbers as before: multiply e =1 and i 2 by the set of positive reals without zero. A way to represent the real numbers addition is with the real number line: What is this figure really? It is not a graph which has a vertex, edge, and vertex. I look at it as a statement of topology: the positive numbers connect to the negative numbers at the additive inverse and nowhere else. Zero provides the bridge between sets of non-zero numbers. The real numbers with both the addition and multiplication operators form a mathematical field. Animations of Time Numbers What do real numbers represent in patterns of events in space-time? Time. Like the real numbers, time is a totally ordered set. One event in time can either be: before another event after another event at the same time as another event for any particular observer. The \"particular observer\" caveat is important from what we know of special relativity. Two observers can and will disagree about what should be said about the order in time of any particular set of events, but each observer individually has a specific ordering. Instead of the label \"real numbers\", I will use the label \"time numbers\". All the properties of real numbers are found in time numbers. I am forcing this jargon change on myself to shift how I view numbers, from something full of the history of mathematics to how Nature may use numbers in space-time. For time numbers, zero is now. The location of now is arbitrary. The past is a distance in time from a past event to now. The future is a distance in time from now to a future event. When one says that there is always an additive inverse, that means there always is a time in the past that is equally far from now as a time in the future is from now. I will do a discrete time animation first. This short film has three times: one for i 2 , 0, and e . Those frames represent the past, now, and future time respectively. My first discrete time number film titled \"100\" has an event in the past and nothing else. I have put the short film on repeat. Here is the film titled \"101\": Notice the symmetry: the past looks exactly like the future. That is the case for half of the eight possible discrete videos. What does zero look like? It depends on which element one uses. If it is e =0, the observer, then now is a blank cube. If it is e =1, the signal, then we expect a box in the now cube. I hope you find this as troubling as I did initially. The roots go back to the two representations of the trivial group that have quite different properties. If e =0, that is the blank, always blank idea of now. This one is easy to accept. It is also easy to accept the signal in the past as a white cube or in the future as a white cube. The idea of treating time as a number is that any moment can be made to be now. When a future signal becomes now, it will still be a signal at time now (aka zero). Another way to view this is that every material object in the universe necessarily requires both representations of the trivial group. If I am looking at the object, it is a signal. If the object is being the observer, it is the center of its own world in time and space. There are 2 3 =8 discrete time number films. I have a difficult time digesting 8 animations (8 stills is far more simple for my brain). The upper left hand corner is all observer, all zeros. The lower right is all signals, all the time. Each horizontal pair is different in the now frame. Each vertical pair is different in the past frame, but has the same now and future. A continuous animation of time creates a conceptual problem: how to deal with infinity. No critical reader will believe an animation started infinitely long ago in the past, not that I have the resources to keep a film going beyond four billion years when the Sun becomes a red giant and envelopes the Earth. I really just need to understand Lie algebras better. That will have to await another day. Let me just assert there should be a way to go from the discrete cyclic group Z 2 to a continuous, smooth group of numbers that are all greater than a negative number a and less than a positive number b . In other words, have a limited section of the time number line including zero. Consider this graph of points on the time number line: An animation of the time number line is nothing more than a steady scan from left to right: There is no space to this animation. Something is either there or not. The moment marked as now should feel completely arbitrary because it is. Now is also brief in this context. You need to watch for it as it blinks by. An essential quality of time numbers is that any point can be designated as now, the additive inverse of zero. But wasn't now forever? Yes for the trivial group, not so with a past and future defined. The Time Number Doublet I have said I want to only write down positive numbers because a minus operator is not associative. That creates a problem. How should I write down a negative number? Perhaps I could insist that the minus sign never be used as an operator, instead always staying \"close\" to the number in question. Yet there is a bigger issue: the group Z 2 looks, well, like it should involve two things. The same applies to the addition rule which has two continuous sets that meet at zero. The two sets have different labels, but otherwise are precisely the same sets. Time numbers are constructed from two different representations of the trivial group, e =0 and e =1. How can we use both? With real numbers, notation is easy: numbers come in 1-tuples: (1), (-2), (0)... No one actually wastes the effort to write parentheses. I propose a new nomenclature for time numbers called the doublet. Let me show, then tell: The rules for doublets are simple: one or two of the numbers inside the square brackets must be zero. A doublet without a zero is not allowed. The first one is the positive number, the second one is the additive inverse. An event described by a time number can be in the future ([ a , 0]), in the past ([0, b ]), or now ([0, 0]), but never in the past and future. Events work that way. Real numbers have the same property: no number can be both positive and negative. Writing out an additive inverse is simplicity itself: All this says is adding the time a in the future plus the time a in the past brings one to now. Hidden But Not a Hidden Variable For the discrete time number animations, I had titles like \"000\" and \"010\". They were visually distinct. Perhaps triplets should be used instead of doublets for time numbers. I suspect that is the wrong approach. How can we learn about zero using addition and multiplication? Addition would provide no information since 0+ a = a . Multiplication is no better, leaving us where we started - at now=0 no matter what number is used. One could just wait until now was in the past. The problem with such an approach is the current now is suffering the same plight. I summarize the situation like so: \"You cannot know yourself, you can only be yourself in the moment.\" All observers, big and subatomic, are in this same boat due to the mathematical logic. Now is not subject to change. Now is. Complex Numbers Start as before by understanding the rules of multiplication. Those rules are contained in the abelian cyclic group Z 4 . Here is the product table: I love how no minus signs are needed since that is one of the oldest rules I learned about the products of complex numbers. Here again my expectations were wrong: I expected two things but have four. Fortunately the group theory nerds are on my side, saying the cyclic group Z 4 over the complex numbers except zero is the reason for the rules of complex number multiplication. The trivial group represented by e =1 lives in the upper left hand corner. The cyclic group Z 2 is also there as the intersection of the first and third columns. The graph of the multiplication will show the same information as the product table to a different part of the brain. The edges with e and i 2 in white loops and the gray cross are bi-directional. The edge in yellow with a white bead is i , but with a black bead is i 3 . These edges are directional. The vertex e times i gets to i , but to go back, one needs to multiply i by i 3 to get to e because four i 's make an e . The i 's go clockwise while i 3 's go counterclockwise. This provides a simple data quality check. The graph for time number multiplication is the diagonal going from e to i 2 . To make these discrete rules for multiplication cover more ground, construct a continuous group by multiplying each of the four elements in Z 4 by the positive reals without zero. This provides an understanding of multiplying complex numbers, but is silent about addition. Addition requires the time number rule plus a new one: e + i 2 = 0 i + i 3 = 0 These two rules again use both ways to represent the trivial group. The key thing to notice is that both rules share the same additive identity. That requires the real number line which contains e and i 2 , must intersect the imaginary one, with i and i 3 like so: This is the complex plane. Addition works like one would expect. Multiplying by a time number expands or contracts how long something is around. Multiplying by an imaginary number creates a rotation of space-time. Animations of Distance-time Numbers What is in a name? That which we call a complex number by any other name would do math as sweet. To assert a connection with events in space-time, I will call complex numbers distance-time numbers. The time (or real) part is a measure from the origin to an event either in the past or the future. The distance is also relative to the origin. The distance is along i or its additive inverse i 3 . Start with a discrete, three frame animation which has a past, now and future spread in space from i 3 to the origin out to i : Introduce a new operator, the conjugate, that puts i values into i 3 and the reverse. Repeat the above animation, but include the conjugate values: The conjugate operator is a spatial mirror. A pair of images are seen on opposite sides of the origin. This animation also happens to be symmetric in time - the past looks like the future. Together, these two symmetries are used in the continuous U(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetism. There are a total of 2 3x3 =512 different animations in this discrete universe with three slots for time and three for space. One important upgrade from time to distance-time animations is now one can animate strings. In the time number animations, all we saw was blinking. With distance-time animations, there can be strings extended in space. Where there is a string, one can start to make loops like so: One thing I ponder is whether the 512 different discrete animations constitute a complete \"alphabet\" for the continuous complex plane. In other words, any and every pattern in a complex plane could be represented using a combination of the 512 discrete cases. Probably not, but they might be able to approximate every possibility. For the continuous movies (not shown, imagine longer animations), multiplying by a time of 2 makes the distance to now twice as big. The product of two events at time=now which both have i values becomes an event in the past. The product of two time=now events, one with i , the other with i 3 , will be an event in the future. If you find yourself fighting such an interpretation, recall that all that is happening is a left-to-right line scan of the complex plane. Distance-time 2-tuples of Doublets Addition requires 4 straws, one for e , i , i 2 , and i 3 and the cube for e =0. The group Z 4 has the first four elements and Z 1 covers e =0. Two doublets should do the work: The first doublet is better known as the real numbers, the second as the imaginary numbers. When animated, the first doublet is for time, in this case, an event in the future. The second number is a distance, this one along i 3 . Quaternions The pattern used in this essay should be established. Start by explaining the multiplication rule using a discrete group. Show the graph for that group. Write out the rules for addition and its topology. Show an animated version of the number. The only thing that changes is that the story gets more complicated. The logical consistency can be checked at any time by looking for the trivial group Z 1 with both representations, Z 2 , and Z 4 at any stage of the process. I have always described a quaternion as three complex numbers that share the same real number. See what happens if one uses that idea with the group Z 4 to write out the product table for quaternion multiplication: Notice how the highlighted rows are identical. You should also be able to spot three columns that have the same property. This suggests we could introduce a new label that was a composition of these three rows: I 2 = ( i 2 + j 2 + k 2 )/3 Instead of a product table with 10x10 rows, the substitution would lead to one that was 8x8 which looks like so: The result is not a cyclic group due to the reduction of terms. This exercise has derived the quaternion group Q 8 . That group provides the rules of quaternion multiplication so abstract no minus signs are needed. Note that often people use them, but it is not necessary. I still find this odd, but it is consistent with the story told so far. The trivial group Z 1 and cyclic groups Z 2 and Z 4 live in the upper left hand quarter of the product table. Notice how elements in that quarter are symmetric over the diagonal. This is a sign that the three groups are abelian, meaning the order of multiplication does not matter. The same cannot be said for the quaternion group Q 8 . The off diagonal elements are the same if one of the terms is e or I 2 . Otherwise, the off-diagonal terms are the same element - and i , j , or k - but will be to the first power on one side and a cube on the other. If you have played Sudoku, you will notice that each of the eight elements appears only once per row and once per column. The graph for multiplication using the quaternion group Q 8 is the most complex we have seen so far: The complex planes run along diagonals. One error checking technique I use is to make sure the white directional beads go in a circle opposite of the black ones. You should be able to spot several complex planes, six in all. Addition must be just like before, only more complicated, four lines instead of two: e + I 2 = 0 i + i 3 = 0 j + j 3 = 0 k + k 3 = 0 All share the same zero, the additive inverse. When I constructed this with a hot glue gun, it was simple enough to have six straws line up and pass through the cube which has six faces. It was appropriate to put the spatial ones there. The white and gray straws stick out from corners, hanging on to three edges with a big wad of glue. It might have been more accurate to do all the addition and multiplication steps using animation. Such an effort will have to wait. One thing should be striking: complex numbers look like they are great to deal with flat planes, while quaternions are obviously designed for the animated 3D world we live in: Modern mathematical physics uses complex numbers and avoids quaternions. Visually, I can no longer defend the status quo. Animations for Space-time Numbers I favor using the label \"space-time numbers\" over quaternions for a few reasons. Hamilton chose \"quaternions\" to emphasize the four-ness of his big insight since he had spent a fruitless decade trying to multiply - and divide - triplets of numbers. The name suggests four equal partners. There is a separation between one part and the other three. That is clear from the dash in space-time numbers. Quaternions were thought of as a series of multiplication rules over four real numbers. In this essay, I have gone to great lengths to start from the trivial group. Space-time numbers are not a mathematical field because they do not commute. That makes quaternions a division algebra, a post some consider less lofty. The thing to recall is that from any and all places in space-time, it is possible to get to any other place in space-time with the rules of addition and multiplication set out for space-time numbers. It is also possible to go back, because there is both an additive and multiplicative inverse. The largest surprise was the size of the discrete possible animations. A cell could be filled in or blank. There is the past, now, and future. Space has 3 3 =27 possibilities. The number of discrete films one could make with this limited palette is 2 3x27 =2 81 =\\~2.4x10 24 . This so swamps the 512 possible discrete distance-time number of animations. Nature has impressive diversity. Space-time numbers - even the discrete collection - looks like it is large enough to encompass Nature's diversity. Here is a simple animation: linear motion. The time-numbers always has a signal. The distance-time numbers moves to the right. The space-time numbers moves right and down. There are 26 different lines one could follow. An open question is how to map from the distance-time numbers to the space-time numbers since the latter has two more degrees of freedom. The animation of a string for distance-time numbers can also be done for space-time numbers: I added a twist in the future of space-time numbers in the third panel that is not visible in the distance-time numbers in the middle. Extra degrees of freedom can have visible consequences. Here are the loops: I did make a lot of arbitrary choices in the final panel. That is what having a discrete space of 2.4x10 24 possibilities is like. There are also new things that can happen. For example, consider a dynamic membrane, an area that moves: I have no idea how to work with dynamic membranes. Backwards From Space-time Numbers This essay has built up quaternions from the decidedly simple, isolated trivial group to the eight members of the quaternion group Q 8 that all connect to zero. The process was additive. Without being destructive, can we see the simpler structures of distance-time and time numbers in space-time numbers? Start with this summary image: Become red-green-yellow color blind. For addition, there are three straws above the white/gray line, and three straws below. For distance-time numbers, the three straws above act as one imaginary basis, the other three as the cube of that basis. The gray straw is the square of this new basis. Going from the cube to the plane looks like a good math puzzle. For each color, one of the complex planes involves e and i 2 . This would have to be the final plane. Then one would have to come up with a few rules about how to go from red-green-yellow to just one color. To get the animation to be like a distance-time, only count two of the three dimensions. For example, give credit for how top or bottom it is, but ignore how much it is left/right and up/down. For the time numbers, one approach is to take the results of the distance-time numbers and roll up the paper, so the plane become a tube along the time number line. Alternatively, one could either take the square of any imaginary value which then tosses things onto the i 2 line. One might prefer to work with the norm of imaginary numbers that puts numbers onto e. For the animation, the only thing that counts is if there is a signal in the cube. Space-time 4-tuple of Doublets Quaternions can be viewed as a 4-tuple of real numbers. That will not work for space-time numbers that start one step below real numbers with two representations of the trivial group. An 8-tuple would be so wrong. A 4-tuple of doublets may make sense: Some might object to writing at least 4 zeroes every time. In this case, 5 zeroes were needed. I would argue this is how we normally describe events, but we use silence for the zeroes. Say we observe something in the past, to the left, high in the sky in front of us. We don't have to say the event was not in the future, it was not on the right, nor was it below and behind us. The doublet notation makes these four implicit statements explicit. For anyone who has made it to the end, thanks for reading.

They are also one of many Clifford algebras, Cl (0, 2) being its formal name. In this essay, the physics of space-time will drive the discussion, not accidents of history. The words for real and imaginary numbers arose from a catfight between mathematicians over complex numbers. The labels I will use always have to be tied to space-time. Please consider this odd constraint a playful way to think differently about numbers for physics The method for constructing quaternions with the roots in space-time will start with discrete groups. A discrete group can be made continuous. The theory of Lie groups provides the background for such a process. Physics is about stuff in motion. With both \"stuff\" and \"motion\" broadly defined, animations will be provided. I will detail the rules for addition, multiplication, and animations for 0, the real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. Going into this much detail requires my longest essay ever.

It has one member, call it the identity element e, so the entire set is {e}. Mathematicians have provided a horrible label for this group since it sounds unworthy of careful consideration. I was going to do the same until I thought about how I was going to make a short film of this discrete group. It is the shortest of all possible films, lasting exactly one frame. I talked with the cinematographer, the lighting director, and the artistic director about the shoot: they all thought it would be easy. The key grip interrupted my mumbling to myself to ask what we were going to take a picture of? The math consultant on the set said anything and everything can be considered a way to represent the trivial group. The permutation operator, call it p , means epe=e . The permutation operator works on any number or object to be found in the Universe. Making a one frame film about everything did not sound practical. I remembered Peano's work where he built number theory up from 0 and 1. I will focus on two operators, addition and multiplication, because together those are needed to make a mathematical field. A mathematical field in turn is the ground floor needed for calculus, the study of change in space-time. With representation theory, one makes an abstract group concrete. For the two sets of number {0} and {1} and the two operators addition and multiplication, one can represent the trivial group with ({0}, +), ({0}, x), and ({1}, x) but not ({1}, +). Here is a way to view the topology, how numbers are connected. Downright trivial, as expected. There is only one thing, the black cube on a black background. This image will get more complicated as new numbers are examined. The multiplication operator allows us to use either of the binary buddies to represent the trivial group. Here are the 4 needed qualities for e =1: There is closure: 1 x 1 = 1 There is an identity: 1 There is an inverse element in the group: 1 The operations are associative: (1 x 1) x 1 = 1 x (1 x 1) The same can be done for e =0: There is closure: 0 x 0 = 0 There is an identity: 0 There is an inverse element in the group: 0 The operations are associative: (0 x 0) x 0 = 0 x (0 x 0) Notice I was careful not to talk about division. The operator is multiplication and the set needs an inverse of multiplication. The set has one element, and that element happens to be its own inverse with the multiplication operator. There is a good reason to never mention subtraction or division as operators. Neither of them is associative: ( a - b ) - c != a - ( b - c ) ( a / b ) / c != a / ( b / c ) These two operators are so ingrained in me, it is hard to part with them, but I will do it for the sake of associativity and group theory :-) Below is the product table, describing all possible multiplication products: Trivial again because e x e = e . The same information can be presented with graph theory, where the cubes are vertices and the edges are the multipliers: The vertex in the graph is the cube, the edge is the pipe cleaner. The rule for multiplication is vertex times an edge goes to a vertex. In this simple case, the edge makes a loop. I also included a white straw as a way to represent the continuous version of the e =1 trivial group. Recall one of the fundamental differences between zero and one under multiplication: n x 1 = n n x 0 = 0 Think of the message these two simple equations tell. In the first case any number gets to stay just like themselves. In the second case, the number must become like 0. This is a source of tension in these two ways to represent the trivial group with the multiplication operator. Try to make the trivial group cover more ground by using the set of positive real numbers that do not have zero, R + \\{0}. A continuous group is formed by multiplying the trivial group represented by e =1 times every element in the infinite set R + \\{0}. Each element in this continuous group will have a multiplicative inverse. This part of the story is exclusively about multiplication. Repeat this process exactly as before except to use e =0 as the representative of the trivial group. Zero times the positive reals without zero always generates a zero. The group remains trivial, having only one member. I don't want to go overboard with the following claim, but it is the kind of thing that makes thinking about physics interesting while I walk around. One profound mystery in physics is how processes can be discrete as well as continuous, the proverbial wave/particle duality. It would be cool if the root of this mystery was an appreciation of the trivial group.","title":"Zero, One, and the Positive Real Numbers"},{"location":"Math/complex_quaternions/#the-trivial-film","text":"Here is the one frame trivial film represented by e =0: In space-time, now ( e =0) goes on and on forever. The idea that this one frame animation would last a billion years struck me as odd initially. Yet \"now\" is something that is always in space-time without anyone's intervention. Now requires no energy. I don't think I can honestly make an animation of the trivial group represented by e =1, or its continuous extension R + \\{0}. The problem is with start of the film. It necessarily is in the future. Because zero is explicitly excluded, there is no now to start the film to then see what the future looks like based on a math model. Is the trivial group a mathematical field? It is time for me to open \"Principles of Mathematical Analysis\" by Rudin and turn to page 5. One needs both addition and multiplication to have group properties. Check. The distributive law must also hold. Check. All three of these work in the case for e =0. There is a stipulation (M4) that the multiplicative inverse is not equal to the additive inverse. Therefore the trivial group is not a mathematical field. I will define something called the trivial mathematical field. It has every rule set out in Rudin without the requirement that the additive inverse be distinct from the multiplicative one. The trivial group represented by the set {0} and the addition and multiplication operators forms a trivial mathematical field. The trivial group represented by the set {1} and multiplication is not a trivial mathematical field. Some might complain that the trivial mathematical field is beyond dull. I argue that change can only be understood against a backdrop that has no capacity to change. It is the canvas for change. \"Now\" is an unchanging quality of the Universe. I sometime call it the observer where the observer is as passive as can be imagined. By contrast, I think of one as a signal in space-time. The trivial group will be there in all subsequent discussions of the real numbers, the complex numbers, and quaternions. The tension between zero/now/observer and one/signal will remain.","title":"The Trivial Film"},{"location":"Math/complex_quaternions/#the-real-numbers","text":"Start by understanding the rules for multiplication that require the abelian cyclic group Z 2 , also known as the sign group. Here is the product table: In practice, the way to use a product table is to pick one value from the first column then multiply it by something from the top row to get the result from where they meet in the table. So e x e = e which is the trivial group product discussed in the previous section and e x i 2 = i 2 . Because the off diagonal elements are symmetric, the group is abelian, meaning the order of multiplication does not matter. The labels one uses for the product table (the e and i 2 ) don't matter unless one wants to tell a longer, logically consistent story. Since I have to pass through complex numbers on the way to quaternions, the i 2 will be helpful. The folks at groupprops.subwiki.org use x, but -1 is common. To be honest, I use -1 to check I did things right. Graph theory can be used to communicate the same information: The vertices are the cubes, the edges are the pipe cleaners. The trivial group represented by e =0 in black is here. The trivial group represented by e =1 is here too. The gray cube with the white loop is not the trivial group since it involves both e and i 2 . The four products in the product table should be easy to find in the graph. If the information is exactly the same, why present both the product table and graph? The reason is biological: language is processed in a different part of the brain that the visuals (which happens against the back wall of the skull). More processing power is built into visual analysis, so it would be good to have a precise visual representation of these ideas. It is common practice to not include the white loops. I am consistently against dropping \"obvious\" information. Explicit trumps implicit. The gray pipe cleaner is bi-directional because the vertex e times i 2 gets to the i 2 vertex, while i 2 times i 2 returns to e . While the discrete groups may help us understand multiplication, to get closure with addition we often need infinite sets. Start with a discrete example: e + i 2 = 0 The astute reader will notice how this expression needs both possible representations for the trivial group: e =0 and e =1, the additive and multiplicative identities respectively. It is the multiplicative identity that can be used to cover all the real numbers as before: multiply e =1 and i 2 by the set of positive reals without zero. A way to represent the real numbers addition is with the real number line: What is this figure really? It is not a graph which has a vertex, edge, and vertex. I look at it as a statement of topology: the positive numbers connect to the negative numbers at the additive inverse and nowhere else. Zero provides the bridge between sets of non-zero numbers. The real numbers with both the addition and multiplication operators form a mathematical field.","title":"The Real Numbers"},{"location":"Math/complex_quaternions/#animations-of-time-numbers","text":"What do real numbers represent in patterns of events in space-time? Time. Like the real numbers, time is a totally ordered set. One event in time can either be: before another event after another event at the same time as another event for any particular observer. The \"particular observer\" caveat is important from what we know of special relativity. Two observers can and will disagree about what should be said about the order in time of any particular set of events, but each observer individually has a specific ordering. Instead of the label \"real numbers\", I will use the label \"time numbers\". All the properties of real numbers are found in time numbers. I am forcing this jargon change on myself to shift how I view numbers, from something full of the history of mathematics to how Nature may use numbers in space-time. For time numbers, zero is now. The location of now is arbitrary. The past is a distance in time from a past event to now. The future is a distance in time from now to a future event. When one says that there is always an additive inverse, that means there always is a time in the past that is equally far from now as a time in the future is from now. I will do a discrete time animation first. This short film has three times: one for i 2 , 0, and e . Those frames represent the past, now, and future time respectively. My first discrete time number film titled \"100\" has an event in the past and nothing else. I have put the short film on repeat. Here is the film titled \"101\": Notice the symmetry: the past looks exactly like the future. That is the case for half of the eight possible discrete videos. What does zero look like? It depends on which element one uses. If it is e =0, the observer, then now is a blank cube. If it is e =1, the signal, then we expect a box in the now cube. I hope you find this as troubling as I did initially. The roots go back to the two representations of the trivial group that have quite different properties. If e =0, that is the blank, always blank idea of now. This one is easy to accept. It is also easy to accept the signal in the past as a white cube or in the future as a white cube. The idea of treating time as a number is that any moment can be made to be now. When a future signal becomes now, it will still be a signal at time now (aka zero). Another way to view this is that every material object in the universe necessarily requires both representations of the trivial group. If I am looking at the object, it is a signal. If the object is being the observer, it is the center of its own world in time and space. There are 2 3 =8 discrete time number films. I have a difficult time digesting 8 animations (8 stills is far more simple for my brain). The upper left hand corner is all observer, all zeros. The lower right is all signals, all the time. Each horizontal pair is different in the now frame. Each vertical pair is different in the past frame, but has the same now and future. A continuous animation of time creates a conceptual problem: how to deal with infinity. No critical reader will believe an animation started infinitely long ago in the past, not that I have the resources to keep a film going beyond four billion years when the Sun becomes a red giant and envelopes the Earth. I really just need to understand Lie algebras better. That will have to await another day. Let me just assert there should be a way to go from the discrete cyclic group Z 2 to a continuous, smooth group of numbers that are all greater than a negative number a and less than a positive number b . In other words, have a limited section of the time number line including zero. Consider this graph of points on the time number line: An animation of the time number line is nothing more than a steady scan from left to right: There is no space to this animation. Something is either there or not. The moment marked as now should feel completely arbitrary because it is. Now is also brief in this context. You need to watch for it as it blinks by. An essential quality of time numbers is that any point can be designated as now, the additive inverse of zero. But wasn't now forever? Yes for the trivial group, not so with a past and future defined.","title":"Animations of Time Numbers"},{"location":"Math/complex_quaternions/#the-time-number-doublet","text":"I have said I want to only write down positive numbers because a minus operator is not associative. That creates a problem. How should I write down a negative number? Perhaps I could insist that the minus sign never be used as an operator, instead always staying \"close\" to the number in question. Yet there is a bigger issue: the group Z 2 looks, well, like it should involve two things. The same applies to the addition rule which has two continuous sets that meet at zero. The two sets have different labels, but otherwise are precisely the same sets. Time numbers are constructed from two different representations of the trivial group, e =0 and e =1. How can we use both? With real numbers, notation is easy: numbers come in 1-tuples: (1), (-2), (0)... No one actually wastes the effort to write parentheses. I propose a new nomenclature for time numbers called the doublet. Let me show, then tell: The rules for doublets are simple: one or two of the numbers inside the square brackets must be zero. A doublet without a zero is not allowed. The first one is the positive number, the second one is the additive inverse. An event described by a time number can be in the future ([ a , 0]), in the past ([0, b ]), or now ([0, 0]), but never in the past and future. Events work that way. Real numbers have the same property: no number can be both positive and negative.

Addition would provide no information since 0+ a = a . Multiplication is no better, leaving us where we started - at now=0 no matter what number is used. One could just wait until now was in the past. The problem with such an approach is the current now is suffering the same plight. I summarize the situation like so: \"You cannot know yourself, you can only be yourself in the moment.\" All observers, big and subatomic, are in this same boat due to the mathematical logic.

Now is.","title":"Hidden But Not a Hidden Variable"},{"location":"Math/complex_quaternions/#complex-numbers","text":"Start as before by understanding the rules of multiplication. Those rules are contained in the abelian cyclic group Z 4 . Here is the product table: I love how no minus signs are needed since that is one of the oldest rules I learned about the products of complex numbers. Here again my expectations were wrong: I expected two things but have four. Fortunately the group theory nerds are on my side, saying the cyclic group Z 4 over the complex numbers except zero is the reason for the rules of complex number multiplication. The trivial group represented by e =1 lives in the upper left hand corner. The cyclic group Z 2 is also there as the intersection of the first and third columns. The graph of the multiplication will show the same information as the product table to a different part of the brain. The edges with e and i 2 in white loops and the gray cross are bi-directional. The edge in yellow with a white bead is i , but with a black bead is i 3 . These edges are directional. The vertex e times i gets to i , but to go back, one needs to multiply i by i 3 to get to e because four i 's make an e . The i 's go clockwise while i 3 's go counterclockwise. This provides a simple data quality check. The graph for time number multiplication is the diagonal going from e to i 2 . To make these discrete rules for multiplication cover more ground, construct a continuous group by multiplying each of the four elements in Z 4 by the positive reals without zero. This provides an understanding of multiplying complex numbers, but is silent about addition. Addition requires the time number rule plus a new one: e + i 2 = 0 i + i 3 = 0 These two rules again use both ways to represent the trivial group. The key thing to notice is that both rules share the same additive identity. That requires the real number line which contains e and i 2 , must intersect the imaginary one, with i and i 3 like so: This is the complex plane. Addition works like one would expect. Multiplying by a time number expands or contracts how long something is around. Multiplying by an imaginary number creates a rotation of space-time.","title":"Complex Numbers"},{"location":"Math/complex_quaternions/#animations-of-distance-time-numbers","text":"What is in a name? That which we call a complex number by any other name would do math as sweet. To assert a connection with events in space-time, I will call complex numbers distance-time numbers. The time (or real) part is a measure from the origin to an event either in the past or the future. The distance is also relative to the origin. The distance is along i or its additive inverse i 3 . Start with a discrete, three frame animation which has a past, now and future spread in space from i 3 to the origin out to i : Introduce a new operator, the conjugate, that puts i values into i 3 and the reverse. Repeat the above animation, but include the conjugate values: The conjugate operator is a spatial mirror. A pair of images are seen on opposite sides of the origin. This animation also happens to be symmetric in time - the past looks like the future. Together, these two symmetries are used in the continuous U(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetism. There are a total of 2 3x3 =512 different animations in this discrete universe with three slots for time and three for space. One important upgrade from time to distance-time animations is now one can animate strings. In the time number animations, all we saw was blinking. With distance-time animations, there can be strings extended in space. Where there is a string, one can start to make loops like so: One thing I ponder is whether the 512 different discrete animations constitute a complete \"alphabet\" for the continuous complex plane. In other words, any and every pattern in a complex plane could be represented using a combination of the 512 discrete cases. Probably not, but they might be able to approximate every possibility. For the continuous movies (not shown, imagine longer animations), multiplying by a time of 2 makes the distance to now twice as big. The product of two events at time=now which both have i values becomes an event in the past. The product of two time=now events, one with i , the other with i 3 , will be an event in the future.

Start by explaining the multiplication rule using a discrete group. Show the graph for that group. Write out the rules for addition and its topology. Show an animated version of the number. The only thing that changes is that the story gets more complicated. The logical consistency can be checked at any time by looking for the trivial group Z 1 with both representations, Z 2 , and Z 4 at any stage of the process. I have always described a quaternion as three complex numbers that share the same real number. See what happens if one uses that idea with the group Z 4 to write out the product table for quaternion multiplication: Notice how the highlighted rows are identical. You should also be able to spot three columns that have the same property. This suggests we could introduce a new label that was a composition of these three rows: I 2 = ( i 2 + j 2 + k 2 )/3 Instead of a product table with 10x10 rows, the substitution would lead to one that was 8x8 which looks like so: The result is not a cyclic group due to the reduction of terms. This exercise has derived the quaternion group Q 8 . That group provides the rules of quaternion multiplication so abstract no minus signs are needed. Note that often people use them, but it is not necessary. I still find this odd, but it is consistent with the story told so far. The trivial group Z 1 and cyclic groups Z 2 and Z 4 live in the upper left hand quarter of the product table. Notice how elements in that quarter are symmetric over the diagonal. This is a sign that the three groups are abelian, meaning the order of multiplication does not matter. The same cannot be said for the quaternion group Q 8 . The off diagonal elements are the same if one of the terms is e or I 2 . Otherwise, the off-diagonal terms are the same element - and i , j , or k - but will be to the first power on one side and a cube on the other. If you have played Sudoku, you will notice that each of the eight elements appears only once per row and once per column. The graph for multiplication using the quaternion group Q 8 is the most complex we have seen so far: The complex planes run along diagonals. One error checking technique I use is to make sure the white directional beads go in a circle opposite of the black ones. You should be able to spot several complex planes, six in all. Addition must be just like before, only more complicated, four lines instead of two: e + I 2 = 0 i + i 3 = 0 j + j 3 = 0 k + k 3 = 0 All share the same zero, the additive inverse. When I constructed this with a hot glue gun, it was simple enough to have six straws line up and pass through the cube which has six faces. It was appropriate to put the spatial ones there. The white and gray straws stick out from corners, hanging on to three edges with a big wad of glue. It might have been more accurate to do all the addition and multiplication steps using animation. Such an effort will have to wait. One thing should be striking: complex numbers look like they are great to deal with flat planes, while quaternions are obviously designed for the animated 3D world we live in: Modern mathematical physics uses complex numbers and avoids quaternions.

Hamilton chose \"quaternions\" to emphasize the four-ness of his big insight since he had spent a fruitless decade trying to multiply - and divide - triplets of numbers. The name suggests four equal partners. There is a separation between one part and the other three. That is clear from the dash in space-time numbers. Quaternions were thought of as a series of multiplication rules over four real numbers. In this essay, I have gone to great lengths to start from the trivial group. Space-time numbers are not a mathematical field because they do not commute. That makes quaternions a division algebra, a post some consider less lofty. The thing to recall is that from any and all places in space-time, it is possible to get to any other place in space-time with the rules of addition and multiplication set out for space-time numbers. It is also possible to go back, because there is both an additive and multiplicative inverse. The largest surprise was the size of the discrete possible animations. A cell could be filled in or blank. There is the past, now, and future. Space has 3 3 =27 possibilities. The number of discrete films one could make with this limited palette is 2 3x27 =2 81 =\\~2.4x10 24 . This so swamps the 512 possible discrete distance-time number of animations. Nature has impressive diversity. Space-time numbers - even the discrete collection - looks like it is large enough to encompass Nature's diversity. Here is a simple animation: linear motion. The time-numbers always has a signal. The distance-time numbers moves to the right. The space-time numbers moves right and down. There are 26 different lines one could follow. An open question is how to map from the distance-time numbers to the space-time numbers since the latter has two more degrees of freedom. The animation of a string for distance-time numbers can also be done for space-time numbers: I added a twist in the future of space-time numbers in the third panel that is not visible in the distance-time numbers in the middle. Extra degrees of freedom can have visible consequences. Here are the loops: I did make a lot of arbitrary choices in the final panel. That is what having a discrete space of 2.4x10 24 possibilities is like. There are also new things that can happen.

Start with this summary image: Become red-green-yellow color blind. For addition, there are three straws above the white/gray line, and three straws below. For distance-time numbers, the three straws above act as one imaginary basis, the other three as the cube of that basis. The gray straw is the square of this new basis. Going from the cube to the plane looks like a good math puzzle. For each color, one of the complex planes involves e and i 2 . This would have to be the final plane. Then one would have to come up with a few rules about how to go from red-green-yellow to just one color. To get the animation to be like a distance-time, only count two of the three dimensions. For example, give credit for how top or bottom it is, but ignore how much it is left/right and up/down. For the time numbers, one approach is to take the results of the distance-time numbers and roll up the paper, so the plane become a tube along the time number line. Alternatively, one could either take the square of any imaginary value which then tosses things onto the i 2 line.

It holds every event that has ever happened since the big bang, and all future events everywhere. An equivalence class can be used to partition space-time into smaller, disjoint sets. Here is a simple example: the past and the future are separated by now. Observations of Nature involve looking at differences which is why dt and dR are used. The measurement of time is a real number while measurements of space uses three imaginary numbers. An equivalence relation can be defined to say what it means to be at the same time in the future or the past: Knowing if something is in the past or the future uses only the real part of a quaternion. The equivalence class of one day in the future does use where one happens to be. A similar analysis can be done to divide space into equivalence classes such as left and right separate by here, or up and down separated by here, or near and far separated by here. Look at the first case: Notice that there is one line that divides space-time. The equivalence classes all are straight. For space, the equivalence relation isolates the imaginary values: When things happen - the real part - does not matter when partitioning by here, a spatial difference of zero from the reference observer. Where is plus and minus one? Quaternions can be viewed as three complex numbers that share the same real value where the product of any two imaginaries is plus or minus the third imaginary number, the sign depending on the order of the product.

This means that I 0 or I 4 are the same as +1, and I 2 is the same as -1. Why bother? It helps make clear that the reals can mingle with the imaginary. The real and imaginary numbers are cut from the same cloth. It is allowed to work with a factor of \"I\" that is raised to a number that is not an integer. The rules for multiplying the three complex numbers together are found in the larger quaternion group Q 8 . Time + space equivalence classes Equivalence classes can be combined. Do so with here and now as the separators: Notice how nice and square things are. This is Newtonian physics. Both time and space are absolutes and do not mix with each other. The light cone as a divider of space-time Light has an interval of zero: the changes in time are exactly equal to the changes in space. Space-time is separated into two regions where the origin can have a causal relationship with other event - the time-like areas - and there are the regions that are too far away in space-time for a photon to reach the origin: These regions are separate. It no longer makes sense to draw an equivalence class as a straight line because that line would then not remain in the separate regions. If two events are the same interval away from the origin, then they are both on the same hyperbola. The equivalence relation uses the square of a quaternion: The only thing that is different in the equivalence relation between time and this one for special relativity is using a quaternion to the first or second power respectively. Combine the time and causality equivalence classes: Notice that the future time-like cone is all the same yellow as is the past time-like cone. The space-like regions have two tones because the upper part is in the future while the lower is in the past. A hyperbola travels between the two. Therefore one cannot say if a space-like event is in the past or the future. The equivalence relation combines the one for time and causality: This has equivalence relations in linear and quadratic function of quaternions. Combine the space and causality equivalence classes: Space is a solid color which makes total since one used the space equivalence class. It is time that is two tone, so left and right, up and down, and near and far depend on the motion of an observer. The equivalence relations would be the same as the previous four cases except that one would work with linear imaginary values. The ability to combine equivalence classes suggest considerable power in this purely geometric approach. Relativistic space + time may be gravity In the classical combination of time and space, the two did not mix. Now allow the two to mix. The result should look like a light cone rotated by 45 degrees. The curved lines cannot be due to a linear time. The least required is a quadratic term. There is also the constraint that this quadratic term must be zero when dt is zero and dR is zero. Thus, the curves must be dtdR. I call these space-times-time, an imaginary quantity. The equivalence relation is the imaginary twin of the one for special relativity: This equivalence could be divided further into each of the four quadrants, but that would be of questionable value. One of the more remarkable features of gravity is the universal attraction - it doesn't know how to change signs. The U(1) and the circle of light So far, four straight lines have been used to slice up space-time. Now try a unit circle. One problem is that if zero is at the origin as one always does, then the space-time plane is not divided into two regions. Instead, let the circle have a value of zero and let a one sit at the origin. This has the equation for a circle. This is also the norm of a quaternion, the product of a quaternion with its conjugate. The norm of one and its additive inverse is one. SU(2) as the imaginary extension of U(1) The weak force as SU(2) as its gauge symmetry group. The group SU(2) is also known as the unit quaternions.

It holds every event that has ever happened since the big bang, and all future events everywhere. An equivalence class can be used to partition space-time into smaller, disjoint sets. Here is a simple example: the past and the future are separated by now. Observations of Nature involve looking at differences which is why dt and dR are used. The measurement of time is a real number while measurements of space uses three imaginary numbers. An equivalence relation can be defined to say what it means to be at the same time in the future or the past: Knowing if something is in the past or the future uses only the real part of a quaternion. The equivalence class of one day in the future does use where one happens to be. A similar analysis can be done to divide space into equivalence classes such as left and right separate by here, or up and down separated by here, or near and far separated by here. Look at the first case: Notice that there is one line that divides space-time. The equivalence classes all are straight. For space, the equivalence relation isolates the imaginary values: When things happen - the real part - does not matter when partitioning by here, a spatial difference of zero from the reference observer.","title":"Using quaternion equivalence classes to understand space-time and physics"},{"location":"Math/equivalence_classes/#where-is-plus-and-minus-one","text":"Quaternions can be viewed as three complex numbers that share the same real value where the product of any two imaginaries is plus or minus the third imaginary number, the sign depending on the order of the product.

I care more about what multiplying two quaternions together can do. There are two basic ways to do this: just multiply one quaternion by another, or first take the transpose of one then multiply it with the other. Each of these products can be separated into two parts: a symmetric (inner product) and an antisymmetric (outer product) components. The symmetric component will remain unchanged by exchanging the places of the quaternions, while the antisymmetric component will change its sign. Together they add up to the product. In this section, both types of inner and outer products will be formed and then related to physics. The Grassman Inner and Outer Products There are two basic ways to multiply quaternions together. There is the direct approach. I call this the Grassman product (I do not know if anyone else does, but I need a label). The inner product can also be called the symmetric product, because it does not change signs if the terms are reversed. I have defined the anticommutator (the bold curly braces) in a non-standard way, including a factor of two so I do not have to keep remembering to write it. The first term would be the Lorentz invariant interval if the two quaternions represented the same difference between two events in spacetime (i.e. t=t'=delta t,...). The invariant interval plays a central role in special relativity. The vector terms are a frame-dependent, symmetric product of space with time and does not appear on the stage of physics, but is still a valid measurement. The Grassman outer product is antisymmetric and is formed with a commutator. This is the cross product defined for two 3-vectors. It is unchanged for quaternions. The Euclidean Inner and Outer Products Another important way to multiply a pair of quaternions involves first taking the conjugate of one of the quaternions. For a real-valued matrix representation, this is equivalent to multiplication by the transpose which involves flipping the sign of the 3-vector. Form the Euclidean inner product. The first term is the Euclidean norm if the two quaternions are the same (this was the reason for using the adjective \"Euclidean\"). The Euclidean inner product is also the standard definition of a dot product. Form the Euclidean outer product. The first term is zero. The vector terms are an antisymmetric product of space with time and the negative of the cross product. Implications When multiplying vectors in physics, one normally only considers the Euclidean inner product, or dot product, and the Grassman outer product, or cross product. Yet, the Grassman inner product, because it naturally generates the invariant interval, appears to play a role in special relativity. What is interesting to speculate about is the role of the Euclidean outer product. It is possible that the antisymmetric, vector nature of the space/time product could be related to spin.

I care more about what multiplying two quaternions together can do. There are two basic ways to do this: just multiply one quaternion by another, or first take the transpose of one then multiply it with the other. Each of these products can be separated into two parts: a symmetric (inner product) and an antisymmetric (outer product) components. The symmetric component will remain unchanged by exchanging the places of the quaternions, while the antisymmetric component will change its sign. Together they add up to the product. In this section, both types of inner and outer products will be formed and then related to physics.","title":"Inner and Outer Products of Quaternions"},{"location":"Math/products/#the-grassman-inner-and-outer-products","text":"There are two basic ways to multiply quaternions together.

I have defined the anticommutator (the bold curly braces) in a non-standard way, including a factor of two so I do not have to keep remembering to write it. The first term would be the Lorentz invariant interval if the two quaternions represented the same difference between two events in spacetime (i.e. t=t'=delta t,...). The invariant interval plays a central role in special relativity. The vector terms are a frame-dependent, symmetric product of space with time and does not appear on the stage of physics, but is still a valid measurement.

An abstract object having a definitely specified system of components in every coordinate system under consideration and such that, under transformation of coordinates, the components of the object undergoes a transformation of a certain nature. To make this introduction less abstract, I will confine the discussion to the simplest tensors under rotational transformations. A rank-0 tensor is known as a scalar. It does not change at all under a rotation. It contains exactly one number, never more or less. There is a zero index for a scalar. A rank-1 tensor is a vector. A vector does change under rotation. Vectors have one index which can run from 1 to the number of dimensions of the field, so there is no way to know a priori how many numbers (or operators, or ...) are in a vector. n-rank tensors have n indices. The number of numbers needed is the number of dimensions in the vector space raised by the rank. Symmetry can often simplify the number of numbers actually needed to describe a tensor. There are a variety of important spin-offs of a standard vector. Dual vectors, when multiplied by its corresponding vector, generate a real number, by systematically multiplying each component from the dual vector and the vector together and summing the total. If the space a vector lives in is shrunk, a contravariant vector shrinks, but a covariant vector gets larger. A tangent vector is, well, tangent to a vector function. Physics equations involve tensors of the same rank. There are scalar equations, polar vector equations, axial vector equations, and equations for higher rank tensors. Since the same rank tensors are on both sides, the identity is preserved under a rotational transformation. One could decide to arbitrarily combine tensor equations of different rank, and they would still be valid under the transformation. There are ways to switch ranks. If there are two vectors and one wants a result that is a scalar, that requires the intervention of a metric to broker the transaction. This process in known as an inner tensor product or a contraction. The vectors in question must have the same number of dimensions. The metric defines how to form a scalar as the indices are examined one-by- one. Metrics in math can be anything, but nature imposes constraints on which ones are important in physics. An aside: mathematicians require that the distance is non-negative, but physicists do not. I will be using the physics notion of a metric. In looking at events in spacetime (a 4-dimensional vector), the axioms of special relativity require the Minkowski metric, which is a 4x4 real matrix that has (1, -1, -1, -1) down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Some people prefer the signs to be flipped, but to be consistent with everything else on this site, I choose this convention. Another popular choice is the Euclidean metric, which is the same as an identity matrix. The result of general relativity for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass is the Schwarzschild metric, which has \"non-one\" terms down the diagonal, zeros elsewhere, and becomes the Minkowski metric in the limit of the mass going to zero or the radius going to infinity. An outer tensor product is a way to increase the rank of tensors. The tensor product of two vectors will be a 2-rank tensor. A vector can be viewed as the tensor product of a set of basis vectors. What Are Quaternions? Quaternions could be viewed as the outer tensor product of a scalar and a 3-vector. Under rotation for an event in spacetime represented by a quaternion, time is unchanged, but the 3-vector for space would be rotated. The treatment of scalars is the same as above, but the notion of vectors is far more restrictive, as restrictive as the notion of scalars. Quaternions can only handle 3-vectors. To those familiar to playing with higher dimensions, this may appear too restrictive to be of interest. Yet physics on both the quantum and cosmological scales is confined to 3-spatial dimensions. Note that the infinite Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics a function of the principle quantum number n, not the spatial dimensions. An infinite collection of quaternions of the form (En, Pn) could represent a quantum state. The Hilbert space is formed using the Euclidean product (q* q'). A dual quaternion is formed by taking the conjugate, because q* q = (t^2 + X.X, 0). A tangent quaternion is created by having an operator act on a quaternion-valued function What would happen to these five terms if space were shrunk? The 3-vector F would get shrunk, as would the divisors in the Del operator, making functions acted on by Del get larger. The scalar terms are completely unaffected by shrinking space, because df/dt has nothing to shrink, and the Del and F cancel each other. The time derivative of the 3-vector is a contravariant vector, because F would get smaller. The gradient of the scalar field is a covariant vector, because of the work of the Del operator in the divisor makes it larger. The curl at first glance might appear as a draw, but it is a covariant vector capacity because of the right-angle nature of the cross product. Note that if time where to shrink exactly as much as space, nothing in the tangent quaternion would change. A quaternion equation must generate the same collection of tensors on both sides. Consider the product of two events, q and q': Where is the axial vector for the left hand side? It is imbedded in the multiplication operation, honest :-) The axial vector is the one that flips signs if the order is reversed. Terms can continue to get more complicated. In a quaternion triple product, there will be terms of the form (XxX').X\". This is called a pseudo-scalar, because it does not change under a rotation, but it will change signs under a reflection, due to the cross product. You can convince yourself of this by noting that the cross product involves the sine of an angle and the dot product involves the cosine of an angle. Neither of these will change under a rotation, and an even function times an odd function is odd. If the order of quaternion triple product is changed, this scalar will change signs for at each step in the permutation. It has been my experience that any tensor in physics can be expressed using quaternions. Sometimes it takes a bit of effort, but it can be done. Individual parts can be isolated if one chooses. Combinations of conjugation operators which flip the sign of a vector, and symmetric and antisymmetric products can isolate any particular term. Here are all the terms of the example from above The metric for quaternions is imbedded in Hamilton's rule for the field. This looks like a way to generate scalars from vectors, but it is more than that. It also says implicitly that i j = k, j k = i, and i, j, k must have inverses. This is an important observation, because it means that inner and outer tensor products can occur in the same operation. When two quaternions are multiplied together, a new scalar (inner tensor product) and vector (outer tensor product) are formed. How can the metric be generalized for arbitrary transformations? The traditional approach would involve playing with Hamilton's rules for the field. I think that would be a mistake, since that rule involves the fundamental definition of a quaternion. Change the rule of what a quaternion is in one context and it will not be possible to compare it to a quaternion in another context. Instead, consider an arbitrary transformation T which takes q into q' T is also a quaternion, in fact it is equal to q' q^-1. This is guaranteed to work locally, within neighborhoods of q and q'. There is no promise that it will work globally, that one T will work for any q. Under certain circumstances, T will work for any q. The important thing to know is that a transformation T necessarily exists because quaternions are a field. The two most important theories in physics, general relativity and the standard model, involve local transformations (but the technical definition of local transformation is different than the idea presented here because it involves groups). This quaternion definition of a transformation creates an interesting relationship between the Minkowski and Euclidean metrics. In order to change from wrist watch time (the interval in spacetime) to the norm of a Hilbert space does not require any change in the transformation quaternion, only a change in the multiplication step. Therefore a transformation which generates the Schwarzschild interval of general relativity should be easily portable to a Hilbert space, and that might be the start of a quantum theory of gravity. So What Is the Difference? I think it is subtle but significant. It goes back to something I learned in a graduate level class on the foundations of calculus. To make calculus rigorous requires that it is defined over a mathematical field. Physicists do this be saying that the scalars, vectors and tensors they work with are defined over the field of real or complex numbers. What are the numbers used by nature? There are events, which consist of the scalar time and the 3-vector of space. There is mass, which is defined by the scalar energy and the 3-vector of momentum. There is the electromagnetic potential, which has a scalar field phi and a 3-vector potential A. To do calculus with only information contained in events requires that a scalar and a 3-vector form a field. According to a theorem by Frobenius on finite dimensional fields, the only fields that fit are isomorphic to the quaternions (isomorphic is a sophisticated notion of equality, whose subtleties are appreciated only by people with a deep understanding of mathematics). To do calculus with a mass or an electromagnetic potential has an identical requirement and an identical solution. This is the logical foundation for doing physics with quaternions. Can physics be done without quaternions? Of course it can! Events can be defined over the field of real numbers, and then the Minkowski metric and the Lorentz group can be deployed to get every result ever confirmed by experiment. Quantum mechanics can be defined using a Hilbert space defined over the field of complex numbers and return with every result measured to date. Doing physics with quaternions is unnecessary, unless physics runs into a compatibility issue. Constraining general relativity and quantum mechanics to work within the same topological algebraic field may be the way to unite these two separately successful areas.","title":"Scalars, Vectors, Tensors and All That"},{"location":"Math/scalars_vectors.book/#scalars-vectors-tensors-and-all-that","text":"According to my math dictionary, a tensor is ...

It does not change at all under a rotation. It contains exactly one number, never more or less. There is a zero index for a scalar. A rank-1 tensor is a vector. A vector does change under rotation. Vectors have one index which can run from 1 to the number of dimensions of the field, so there is no way to know a priori how many numbers (or operators, or ...) are in a vector. n-rank tensors have n indices. The number of numbers needed is the number of dimensions in the vector space raised by the rank. Symmetry can often simplify the number of numbers actually needed to describe a tensor. There are a variety of important spin-offs of a standard vector. Dual vectors, when multiplied by its corresponding vector, generate a real number, by systematically multiplying each component from the dual vector and the vector together and summing the total. If the space a vector lives in is shrunk, a contravariant vector shrinks, but a covariant vector gets larger. A tangent vector is, well, tangent to a vector function. Physics equations involve tensors of the same rank. There are scalar equations, polar vector equations, axial vector equations, and equations for higher rank tensors. Since the same rank tensors are on both sides, the identity is preserved under a rotational transformation. One could decide to arbitrarily combine tensor equations of different rank, and they would still be valid under the transformation. There are ways to switch ranks. If there are two vectors and one wants a result that is a scalar, that requires the intervention of a metric to broker the transaction. This process in known as an inner tensor product or a contraction. The vectors in question must have the same number of dimensions. The metric defines how to form a scalar as the indices are examined one-by- one. Metrics in math can be anything, but nature imposes constraints on which ones are important in physics. An aside: mathematicians require that the distance is non-negative, but physicists do not. I will be using the physics notion of a metric. In looking at events in spacetime (a 4-dimensional vector), the axioms of special relativity require the Minkowski metric, which is a 4x4 real matrix that has (1, -1, -1, -1) down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Some people prefer the signs to be flipped, but to be consistent with everything else on this site, I choose this convention. Another popular choice is the Euclidean metric, which is the same as an identity matrix. The result of general relativity for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass is the Schwarzschild metric, which has \"non-one\" terms down the diagonal, zeros elsewhere, and becomes the Minkowski metric in the limit of the mass going to zero or the radius going to infinity. An outer tensor product is a way to increase the rank of tensors. The tensor product of two vectors will be a 2-rank tensor. A vector can be viewed as the tensor product of a set of basis vectors.","title":"Scalars, Vectors, Tensors and All That"},{"location":"Math/scalars_vectors/#what-are-quaternions","text":"Quaternions could be viewed as the outer tensor product of a scalar and a 3-vector. Under rotation for an event in spacetime represented by a quaternion, time is unchanged, but the 3-vector for space would be rotated. The treatment of scalars is the same as above, but the notion of vectors is far more restrictive, as restrictive as the notion of scalars. Quaternions can only handle 3-vectors. To those familiar to playing with higher dimensions, this may appear too restrictive to be of interest. Yet physics on both the quantum and cosmological scales is confined to 3-spatial dimensions. Note that the infinite Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics a function of the principle quantum number n, not the spatial dimensions. An infinite collection of quaternions of the form (En, Pn) could represent a quantum state. The Hilbert space is formed using the Euclidean product (q* q'). A dual quaternion is formed by taking the conjugate, because q* q = (t^2 + X.X, 0). A tangent quaternion is created by having an operator act on a quaternion-valued function What would happen to these five terms if space were shrunk? The 3-vector F would get shrunk, as would the divisors in the Del operator, making functions acted on by Del get larger. The scalar terms are completely unaffected by shrinking space, because df/dt has nothing to shrink, and the Del and F cancel each other. The time derivative of the 3-vector is a contravariant vector, because F would get smaller. The gradient of the scalar field is a covariant vector, because of the work of the Del operator in the divisor makes it larger. The curl at first glance might appear as a draw, but it is a covariant vector capacity because of the right-angle nature of the cross product. Note that if time where to shrink exactly as much as space, nothing in the tangent quaternion would change. A quaternion equation must generate the same collection of tensors on both sides. Consider the product of two events, q and q': Where is the axial vector for the left hand side? It is imbedded in the multiplication operation, honest :-) The axial vector is the one that flips signs if the order is reversed. Terms can continue to get more complicated. In a quaternion triple product, there will be terms of the form (XxX').X\". This is called a pseudo-scalar, because it does not change under a rotation, but it will change signs under a reflection, due to the cross product. You can convince yourself of this by noting that the cross product involves the sine of an angle and the dot product involves the cosine of an angle. Neither of these will change under a rotation, and an even function times an odd function is odd. If the order of quaternion triple product is changed, this scalar will change signs for at each step in the permutation. It has been my experience that any tensor in physics can be expressed using quaternions. Sometimes it takes a bit of effort, but it can be done. Individual parts can be isolated if one chooses. Combinations of conjugation operators which flip the sign of a vector, and symmetric and antisymmetric products can isolate any particular term. Here are all the terms of the example from above The metric for quaternions is imbedded in Hamilton's rule for the field. This looks like a way to generate scalars from vectors, but it is more than that. It also says implicitly that i j = k, j k = i, and i, j, k must have inverses. This is an important observation, because it means that inner and outer tensor products can occur in the same operation. When two quaternions are multiplied together, a new scalar (inner tensor product) and vector (outer tensor product) are formed. How can the metric be generalized for arbitrary transformations? The traditional approach would involve playing with Hamilton's rules for the field. I think that would be a mistake, since that rule involves the fundamental definition of a quaternion. Change the rule of what a quaternion is in one context and it will not be possible to compare it to a quaternion in another context. Instead, consider an arbitrary transformation T which takes q into q' T is also a quaternion, in fact it is equal to q' q^-1. This is guaranteed to work locally, within neighborhoods of q and q'. There is no promise that it will work globally, that one T will work for any q. Under certain circumstances, T will work for any q. The important thing to know is that a transformation T necessarily exists because quaternions are a field. The two most important theories in physics, general relativity and the standard model, involve local transformations (but the technical definition of local transformation is different than the idea presented here because it involves groups). This quaternion definition of a transformation creates an interesting relationship between the Minkowski and Euclidean metrics. In order to change from wrist watch time (the interval in spacetime) to the norm of a Hilbert space does not require any change in the transformation quaternion, only a change in the multiplication step. Therefore a transformation which generates the Schwarzschild interval of general relativity should be easily portable to a Hilbert space, and that might be the start of a quantum theory of gravity.","title":"What Are Quaternions?"},{"location":"Math/scalars_vectors/#so-what-is-the-difference","text":"I think it is subtle but significant. It goes back to something I learned in a graduate level class on the foundations of calculus. To make calculus rigorous requires that it is defined over a mathematical field. Physicists do this be saying that the scalars, vectors and tensors they work with are defined over the field of real or complex numbers. What are the numbers used by nature? There are events, which consist of the scalar time and the 3-vector of space. There is mass, which is defined by the scalar energy and the 3-vector of momentum. There is the electromagnetic potential, which has a scalar field phi and a 3-vector potential A. To do calculus with only information contained in events requires that a scalar and a 3-vector form a field. According to a theorem by Frobenius on finite dimensional fields, the only fields that fit are isomorphic to the quaternions (isomorphic is a sophisticated notion of equality, whose subtleties are appreciated only by people with a deep understanding of mathematics). To do calculus with a mass or an electromagnetic potential has an identical requirement and an identical solution. This is the logical foundation for doing physics with quaternions. Can physics be done without quaternions? Of course it can! Events can be defined over the field of real numbers, and then the Minkowski metric and the Lorentz group can be deployed to get every result ever confirmed by experiment. Quantum mechanics can be defined using a Hilbert space defined over the field of complex numbers and return with every result measured to date. Doing physics with quaternions is unnecessary, unless physics runs into a compatibility issue. Constraining general relativity and quantum mechanics to work within the same topological algebraic field may be the way to unite these two separately successful areas.","title":"So What Is the Difference?"},{"location":"Math/tools.book/","text":"A Quaternion Algebra Tool Set Here is a compilation of basic algebra for quaternions.

Mathematician are so much more precise than I will ever be. Topological Space If we choose to work systematically through Wald's \"General Relativity\", the starting point is \"Appendix A, Topological Spaces\". Roughly, topology is the structure of relationships that do not change if a space is distorted. Some of the results of topology are required to make calculus rigorous. In this section, I will work consistently with the set of quaternions, H^1, or just H for short. The difference between the real numbers R and H is that H is not a totally ordered set and multiplication is not commutative. These differences are not important for basic topological properties, so statements and proofs involving H are often identical to those for R. First an open ball of quaternions needs to be defined to set the stage for an open set. Define an open ball in H of radius (r, 0) centered around a point (y, Y) [note: small letters are scalars, capital letters are 3-vectors] consisting of points (x, X) such that An open set in H is any set which can be expressed as a union of open balls. [p. 423 translated] A quaternion topological space (H,T) consists of the set H together with a collection T of subsets of H with these properties: The union of an arbitrary collection of subsets, each in T, is in T The intersection of a finite number of subsets of T is in T The entire set H and the empty set are in T T is the topology on H. The subsets of H in T are open sets. Quaternions form a topology because they are what mathematicians call a metric space, since q * q evaluates to a real positive number or equals zero only if q is zero. Note: this is not the meaning of metric used by physicists. For example, the Minkowski metric can be negative or zero even if a point is not zero. To keep the same word with two meanings distinct, I will refer to one as the topological metric, the other as an interval metric. These descriptive labels are not used in general since context usually determines which one is in play. An important component to standard approaches to general relativity is product spaces. This is how a topology for R n is created. Events in spacetime require R 4 , one place for time, three for space. Mathematicians get to make choices: what would change if work was done in R 2 , R 3 , or R 5 ? The precision of this notion, together with the freedom to make choices, makes exploring these decisions fun (for those few who can understand what is going on :-) By working with H, product spaces are unnecessary. Events in spacetime can be members of an open set in H. Time is the scalar, space the 3-vector. There is no choice to be made. Open Sets The edges of sets will be examined by defining boundaries, open and closed sets, and the interior and closure of a set. I am a practical guy who likes pragmatic definitions. Let the real numbers L and U represent arbitrary lower and upper bounds respectively such that L < U. For the quaternion topological space (H, T), consider an arbitrary induced topology (A, t) where x and a are elements of A. Use inequalities to define: The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open. The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open. The union of a finite number of closed sets is closed. The intersection of an arbitrary number of closed sets is closed. Clearly there are connections between the above definitions This creates complementary ideas. [Wald, p.424] The interior of A is the union of all open sets contained within A. The interior equals A if and only if A is open. The closure of A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. The closure of A equals A if and only if A is closed. Define a point set as the set where the lower bound equals the upper bound. The only open set that is a point set is the null set. The closed point set is H. A point set for the real numbers has only one element which is identical to the boundary. A point set for quaternions has an infinite number of elements, one of them identical to the boundary. What are the implications for physics? With quaternions, the existence an open set of events has nothing to do with the causality of that collection of events. A proper time can have exactly the same absolute value as a pure spacelike separation, so these two will be included in the same sets, whether open, closed or on a boundary. There is no correlation the reverse way either. Take for example a collection of lightlike events. Even though they all share exactly the same interval - namely zero - their absolute value can vary all over the map, not staying within limits. Although independent, these two ideas can be combined synergistically. Consider an open set S of timelike intervals. The set S could depict a classical world history since they are causally linked and have good topological properties. A closed set of lightlike events could be a focus of quantum electrodynamics. Topology plus causality could be the key for subdividing different regions of physics. Hausdorff Topology This property is used to analyze compactness, something vital for rigorously establishing differentiation and integration. [Wald p424] The quaternion topological space (H, T) is Hausdorff because for each pair of distinct points a, b E H, a not equal to b, one can find open sets Oa, Ob E T such that a E Oa, b I Ob and the intersection of Oa and Ob is the null set. For example, find the half-way point between a and b. Let that be the radius of an open ball around the points a and b: Neither set quite reaches the other, so their intersection is null. Compact Sets In this section, I will begin an investigation of compact sets of quaternions. I hope to share some of my insights into this subtle but significant topic. First we need the definition of a compact set of quaternions. [Translation of Wald p. 424] Let A be a subset of the quaternions H. Set A could be opened, closed or neither. An open cover of A is the union of open sets {Oa} that contains A. A union of open sets is open and could have an infinite number of members. A subset of {Oa} that still covers A is called a subcover. If the subcover has a finite number of elements it is called a finite subcover. The set A subset of H is compact if every open cover of A has a finite subcover. Let's find an example of a compact set of quaternions. Consider a set S composed of points with a finite number of absolute values: The set S has an infinite number of members, since for any of the equalities, specifying the absolute value still leaves three degrees of freedom (if the domain had been x E R, then S would have had a finite number of elements). The set S can be covered by an open set {O} which could have an infinite number of members. There exists a subset {C} of {O} that is finite and still covers S. The subset {C} would have one member for each absolute value. Every set of quaternions composed of a finite number of absolute values like the set S is compact. Notice that the set S is closed because it consists of a boundary without an interior. The link between compact, closed and bound set is important, and will be examined next A compact set is a statement about the ability to find a finite number of open sets that cover a set, given any open cover. A closed set is the interior of a set plus the boundary of that set. A set is bound if there exists a real number M such that the distance between a point and any member of the set is less than M. For quaternions with the standard topology, in order to have a finite number of open sets that cover the set, the set must necessarily include its boundary and be bound. In other words, to be compact is to be closed and bound, to be closed and bound is to be compact. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 1 (Heine-Borel). A closed interval of quaternions S: with the standard topology on H is compact. Wald does not provide a proof since it appears in many books on analysis. Invariably the Heine-Borel Theorem employs the domain of the real numbers, x E R. However, nothing in that proof changes by using quaternions as the domain. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 2. Let the topology (H, T) be Hausdorff and let the set A subset of H be compact. Then A is closed. Theorem 3. Let the topology (H, T) be compact and let the set A subset of H be closed. Then A is compact. Combine these theorems to create a stronger statement on the compactness of subsets of quaternions H. Theorem 4. A subset A of quaternions is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The property of compactness is easily proved to be preserved under continuous maps. Theorem 5. Let (H, T) and (H', T') be topological spaces. Suppose (H, T) is compact and the function f: H -> H' is continuous. The f[H] = {h' E H' | h' = f(h)} is compact. This creates a corollary by theorem 4. Theorem 6. A continuous function from a compact topological space into H is bound and its absolute value attains a maximum and minimum values. [end translation of Wald] R 1 versus R n It is important to note that these theorems for quaternions are build directly on top of theorems for real numbers, R 1 . Only the domain needs to be changed to H 1 . Wald continues with theorems on product spaces, specifically Tychonoff's Theorem, so that the above theorems can be extended to R n . In particular, the product space R 4 should have the same topology as the quaternions. Hopefully, subtlety matters in the discussion of the logical foundations of general relativity. Both R 1 and H 1 have a rule for multiplication, but H 1 has an antisymmetric component. This is a description of a difference. R 4 does not come equipped with a rule for multiplication, so it is qualitatively different, even if topologically similar to the quaternions.","title":"Topological Properties of Quaternions"},{"location":"Math/topology.book/#topological-properties-of-quaternions","text":"","title":"Topological Properties of Quaternions"},{"location":"Math/topology.book/#i-have-not-taken-a-topology-class-so-no-doubt-this-particular-section-contains-errors","text":"Mathematician are so much more precise than I will ever be.","title":"I have not taken a topology class, so no doubt this particular section contains errors."},{"location":"Math/topology.book/#topological-space","text":"If we choose to work systematically through Wald's \"General Relativity\", the starting point is \"Appendix A, Topological Spaces\".

Theorem 6. A continuous function from a compact topological space into H is bound and its absolute value attains a maximum and minimum values.

Mathematician are so much more precise than I will ever be. Topological Space If we choose to work systematically through Wald's \"General Relativity\", the starting point is \"Appendix A, Topological Spaces\". Roughly, topology is the structure of relationships that do not change if a space is distorted. Some of the results of topology are required to make calculus rigorous. In this section, I will work consistently with the set of quaternions, H^1, or just H for short. The difference between the real numbers R and H is that H is not a totally ordered set and multiplication is not commutative. These differences are not important for basic topological properties, so statements and proofs involving H are often identical to those for R. First an open ball of quaternions needs to be defined to set the stage for an open set. Define an open ball in H of radius (r, 0) centered around a point (y, Y) [note: small letters are scalars, capital letters are 3-vectors] consisting of points (x, X) such that An open set in H is any set which can be expressed as a union of open balls. [p. 423 translated] A quaternion topological space (H,T) consists of the set H together with a collection T of subsets of H with these properties: 1.The union of an arbitrary collection of subsets, each in T, is in T 2.The intersection of a finite number of subsets of T is in T 3.The entire set H and the empty set are in T T is the topology on H. The subsets of H in T are open sets. Quaternions form a topology because they are what mathematicians call a metric space, since q * q evaluates to a real positive number or equals zero only if q is zero. Note: this is not the meaning of metric used by physicists. For example, the Minkowski metric can be negative or zero even if a point is not zero. To keep the same word with two meanings distinct, I will refer to one as the topological metric, the other as an interval metric. These descriptive labels are not used in general since context usually determines which one is in play. An important component to standard approaches to general relativity is product spaces. This is how a topology for R n is created. Events in spacetime require R 4 , one place for time, three for space. Mathematicians get to make choices: what would change if work was done in R 2 , R 3 , or R 5 ? The precision of this notion, together with the freedom to make choices, makes exploring these decisions fun (for those few who can understand what is going on :-) By working with H, product spaces are unnecessary. Events in spacetime can be members of an open set in H. Time is the scalar, space the 3-vector. There is no choice to be made. Open Sets The edges of sets will be examined by defining boundaries, open and closed sets, and the interior and closure of a set. I am a practical guy who likes pragmatic definitions. Let the real numbers L and U represent arbitrary lower and upper bounds respectively such that L < U. For the quaternion topological space (H, T), consider an arbitrary induced topology (A, t) where x and a are elements of A. Use inequalities to define: The union of an arbitrary collection of open sets is open. The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open. The union of a finite number of closed sets is closed. The intersection of an arbitrary number of closed sets is closed. Clearly there are connections between the above definitions This creates complementary ideas. [Wald, p.424] The interior of A is the union of all open sets contained within A. The interior equals A if and only if A is open. The closure of A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A. The closure of A equals A if and only if A is closed. Define a point set as the set where the lower bound equals the upper bound. The only open set that is a point set is the null set. The closed point set is H. A point set for the real numbers has only one element which is identical to the boundary. A point set for quaternions has an infinite number of elements, one of them identical to the boundary. What are the implications for physics? With quaternions, the existence an open set of events has nothing to do with the causality of that collection of events. A proper time can have exactly the same absolute value as a pure spacelike separation, so these two will be included in the same sets, whether open, closed or on a boundary. There is no correlation the reverse way either. Take for example a collection of lightlike events. Even though they all share exactly the same interval - namely zero - their absolute value can vary all over the map, not staying within limits. Although independent, these two ideas can be combined synergistically. Consider an open set S of timelike intervals. The set S could depict a classical world history since they are causally linked and have good topological properties. A closed set of lightlike events could be a focus of quantum electrodynamics. Topology plus causality could be the key for subdividing different regions of physics. Hausdorff Topology This property is used to analyze compactness, something vital for rigorously establishing differentiation and integration. [Wald p424] The quaternion topological space (H, T) is Hausdorff because for each pair of distinct points a, b E H, a not equal to b, one can find open sets Oa, Ob E T such that a E Oa, b I Ob and the intersection of Oa and Ob is the null set. For example, find the half-way point between a and b. Let that be the radius of an open ball around the points a and b: Neither set quite reaches the other, so their intersection is null. Compact Sets In this section, I will begin an investigation of compact sets of quaternions. I hope to share some of my insights into this subtle but significant topic. First we need the definition of a compact set of quaternions. [Translation of Wald p. 424] Let A be a subset of the quaternions H. Set A could be opened, closed or neither. An open cover of A is the union of open sets {Oa} that contains A. A union of open sets is open and could have an infinite number of members. A subset of {Oa} that still covers A is called a subcover. If the subcover has a finite number of elements it is called a finite subcover. The set A subset of H is compact if every open cover of A has a finite subcover. Let's find an example of a compact set of quaternions. Consider a set S composed of points with a finite number of absolute values: The set S has an infinite number of members, since for any of the equalities, specifying the absolute value still leaves three degrees of freedom (if the domain had been x E R, then S would have had a finite number of elements). The set S can be covered by an open set {O} which could have an infinite number of members. There exists a subset {C} of {O} that is finite and still covers S. The subset {C} would have one member for each absolute value. Every set of quaternions composed of a finite number of absolute values like the set S is compact. Notice that the set S is closed because it consists of a boundary without an interior. The link between compact, closed and bound set is important, and will be examined next A compact set is a statement about the ability to find a finite number of open sets that cover a set, given any open cover. A closed set is the interior of a set plus the boundary of that set. A set is bound if there exists a real number M such that the distance between a point and any member of the set is less than M. For quaternions with the standard topology, in order to have a finite number of open sets that cover the set, the set must necessarily include its boundary and be bound. In other words, to be compact is to be closed and bound, to be closed and bound is to be compact. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 1 (Heine-Borel). A closed interval of quaternions S: with the standard topology on H is compact. Wald does not provide a proof since it appears in many books on analysis. Invariably the Heine-Borel Theorem employs the domain of the real numbers, x E R. However, nothing in that proof changes by using quaternions as the domain. [Wald p. 425] Theorem 2. Let the topology (H, T) be Hausdorff and let the set A subset of H be compact. Then A is closed. Theorem 3. Let the topology (H, T) be compact and let the set A subset of H be closed. Then A is compact. Combine these theorems to create a stronger statement on the compactness of subsets of quaternions H. Theorem 4. A subset A of quaternions is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The property of compactness is easily proved to be preserved under continuous maps. Theorem 5. Let (H, T) and (H', T') be topological spaces. Suppose (H, T) is compact and the function f: H -> H' is continuous. The f[H] = {h' E H' | h' = f(h)} is compact. This creates a corollary by theorem 4. Theorem 6. A continuous function from a compact topological space into H is bound and its absolute value attains a maximum and minimum values.

A quaternion differential equation is needed to perform the work of the Dirac equation, but since quaternion operators are a field, an operator that does the task must exist.","title":"Implications"},{"location":"QM/Schrodinger.book/","text":"Deriving A Quaternion Analog to the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation The Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives the kinetic energy plus the potential (a sum also known as the Hamiltonian H) of the wave function psi, which contains all the dynamical information about a system.

For the time-independent case, energy is written at the operator -i hbar d/dt, and kinetic energy as the square of the momentum operator, i hbar Del, over 2m. Given the potential V(0, X) and suitable boundary conditions, solving this differential equation generates a wave function psi which contains all the properties of the system. In this section, the quaternion analog to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation will be derived from first principles. What is interesting are the constraint that are required for the quaternion analog. For example, there is a factor which might serve to damp runaway terms. The Quaternion Wave Function The derivation starts from a curious place :-) Write out classical angular momentum with quaternions. What makes this \"classical\" are the zeroes in the scalars. Make these into complete quaternions by bringing in time to go along with the space 3-vector R, and E with the 3-vector P. Define a dimensionless quaternion psi that is this product over h bar. The scalar part of psi is also seen in plane wave solutions of quantum mechanics. The complicated 3-vector is a new animal, but notice it is composed of all the parts seen in the scalar, just different permutations that evaluate to 3-vectors. One might argue that for completeness, all combinations of E, t, R and P should be involved in psi, as is the case here. Any quaternion can be expressed in polar form: Express psi in polar form. To make things simpler, assume that psi is normalized, so |psi| = 1. The 3-vector of psi is quite complicated, so define one symbol to capture it: Now rewrite psi in polar form with these simplifications: This is what I call the quaternion wave function. Unlike previous work with quaternionic quantum mechanics (see S. Adler's book \"Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics\"), I see no need to define a vector space with right-hand operator multiplication. As was shown in the section on bracket notation, the Euclidean product of psi (psi* psi) will have all the properties required to form a Hilbert space. The advantage of keeping both operators and the wave function as quaternions is that it will make sense to form an interacting field directly using a product such as psi psi'. That will not be done here. Another advantage is that all the equations will necessarily be invertible. Changes in the Quaternion Wave Function We cannot derive the Schr\u00f6dinger equation per se, since that involves Hermitian operators that acting on a complex vector space. Instead, the operators here will be anti-Hermitian quaternions acting on quaternions. Still it will look very similar, down to the last h bar :-) All that needs to be done is to study how the quaternion wave function psi changes. Make the following assumptions. 1. Energy and Momentum are conserved. Energy is evenly distributed in space 3. The system is isolated 4. The position 3-vector X is in the same direction as the momentum 3-vector P The implications of this last assumption are not obvious but can be computed directly by taking the appropriate derivative. Here is a verbal explanation. If energy and momentum are conserved, they will not change in time. If the position 3-vector which does change is always in the same direction as the momentum 3-vector, then I will remain constant in time. Since I is in the direction of X, its curl will be zero. This last constraint may initially appear too confining. Contrast this with the typical classical quantum mechanics. In that case, there is an imaginary factor i which contains no information about the system. It is a mathematical tool tossed in so that the equation has the correct properties. With quaternions, I is determined directly from E, t, P and X. It must be richer in information content. This particular constraint is a reflection of that. Now take the time derivative of psi. The denominator must be at least 1, and can be greater that that. It can serve as a damper, a good thing to tame runaway terms. Unfortunately, it also makes solving explicitly for energy impossible unless Et - P.X equals zero. Since the goal is to make a direct connection to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, make one final assumption: There are several important cases when this will be true. In a vacuum, E and P are zero. If this is used to study photons, then t = |R| and E = |P|. If this number happens to be constant in time, then this equation will apply to the wave front. Now with these 5 assumptions in hand, energy can be defined with an operator. The equivalence of the energy E and this operator is called the first quantization. Take the spatial derivative of psi using the under the same assumptions: Square this operator. The Hamiltonian equals the kinetic energy plus the potential energy. Typographically, this looks very similar to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

It will be argued that quaternions have the properties of a complete inner-product space (a Banach space for the field of quaternions). A central issue is the definition of the square of the norm. In quantum mechanics: In this notebook, the following assertion will be examined (star is the conjugate, so the vector flips signs): The inner-product of two quaternions is defined here as the transpose (or conjugate) of the first quaternion multiplied by the second. The inner product of a function with itself is the norm. The Positive Definite Norm of a Quaternion The square of the norm of a quaternion can only be zero if every element is zero, otherwise it must have a positive value. This is the standard Euclidean norm for a real 4-dimensional vector space. The Euclidean inner-product of two quaternions can take on any value, as is the case in quantum mechanics for <phi|theta>. The adjective \"Euclidean\" is used to distinguish this product from the Grassman inner- product which plays a central role in special relativity (see alternative algebra for boosts). Completeness With the topology of a Euclidean norm for a real 4-dimensional vector space, quaternions are complete. Quaternions are complete in a manner required to form a Banach space if there exists a neighborhood of any quaternion x such that there is a set of quaternions y for some fixed value of epsilon. Construct such a neighborhood. An infinite number of quaternions exist in the neighborhood. Any polynomial equation with quaternion coefficients has a quaternion solution in x (a proof done by Eilenberg and Niven in 1944, cited in Birkhoff and Mac Lane's \"A Survey of Modern Algebra.\") Identities and Inequalities The following identities and inequalities emanate from the properties of a Euclidean norm. They are worked out for quaternions here in detail to solidify the connection between the machinery of quantum mechanics and quaternions. The conjugate of the square of the norm equals the square of the norm of the two terms reversed. For quaternions, These are identical, because the terms involving the cross produce will flip signs when their order changes. For products of squares of norms in quantum mechanics, This is also the case for quaternions. The triangle inequality in quantum mechanics: For quaternions, If the signs of each pair of component are the same, the two sides will be equal. If the signs are different (a t and a -t for example), then the cross terms will cancel on the left hand side of the inequality, making it smaller than the right hand side where terms never cancel because there are only squared terms. The Schwarz inequality in quantum mechanics is analogous to dot products and cosines in Euclidean space. Let a third wave function, chi, be the sum of these two with an arbitrary parameter lambda. The norm of chi will necessarily be greater than zero. Choose the value for lambda that helps combine all the terms containing lambda. Multiply through by the denominator, separate the two resulting terms and do some minor rearranging. This is now the Schwarz inequality. Another inequality: Examine the square of the norm of the difference between two quaternions which is necessarily equal to or greater than zero. The cross terms can be put on the other side of inequality, changing the sign, and leaving the sum of two norms behind. The inequality holds. The parallelogram law: Test the quaternion norm This is twice the square of the norms of the two separate components. Implications In the case for special relativity, it was noticed that by simply squaring a quaternion, the resulting first term was the Lorentz invariant interval. From that solitary observation, the power of a mathematical field was harnessed to solve a wide range of problems in special relativity. In a similar fashion, it is hoped that because the product of a transpose of a quaternion with a quaternion has the properties of a complete inner product space, the power of the mathematical field of quaternions can be used to solve a wide range of problems in quantum mechanics. This is an important area for further research. Note: this goal is different from the one Stephen Adler sets out in \"Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.\" He tries to substitute quaternions in the place of complex numbers in the standard Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. The analytical properties of quaternions do not play a critical role. It is the properties of the Hilbert space over the field of quaternions that is harnessed to solve problems. It is my opinion that since the product of a transpose of a quaternion with a quaternion already has the properties of a norm in a Hilbert space, there is no need to imbed quaternions again within another Hilbert space. I like a close shave with Occam's razor.","title":"A Complete Inner Product Space with Dirac's Bracket Notation"},{"location":"QM/bracket_notation.book/#a-complete-inner-product-space-with-diracs-bracket-notation","text":"A mathematical connection between the bracket notation of quantum mechanics and quaternions is detailed.

This is the kernel required to form a unified representation of integral and half integral spin. Imagine adding up a series of these small rotations, say 2 pi of these. No doubt the identity and conjugates will bring you back exactly where you started. The first and second conjugates in the commutator will point in the opposite direction.

If we want to represent quaternions with automorphisms, 4 are required: They are the identity automorphism, the conjugate anti-automorphism, the first conjugate anti-automorphism, and the second conjugate anti-automorphism: where e1, e2, e3 are orthogonal basis vectors The most important automorphism is the identity. Life is stable around small permutations of the identity:-) The conjugate flips the signs of the each component in the 3-vector. These two automorphisms, the identity and the conjugate, treat the 3-vector as a unit. The first and second conjugate flip the signs of all terms but the first and second terms, respectively. Therefore these operators act on only the two of the three components in the 3-vector. By acting on only two of three components, a commutator will behave differently. This small difference in behavior inside a commutator is what creates the ability to represent integral and half-integral spins. Small Rotations Small rotations about the origin will now be calculated. These will then be expressed in terms of the four automorphisms discussed above. I will be following the approach used in J. J. Sakurai's book \"Modern Quantum Mechanics\", chapter 3, making modifications necessary to accommodate quaternions. First, consider rotations about the origin in the z axis. Define: Two technical points. First, Sakurai considered rotations around any point along the z axis. This analysis is confined to the z axis at the origin, a significant but not unreasonable constraint. Second, these rotations are written with generalized coordinates instead of the very familiar and comfortable x, y, z. This extra effort will be useful when considering how rotations are effected by curved spacetime. This machinery is also necessary to do quaternion analysis (please see that section, it's great :-) There are similar rotations around the first and second axes at the origin; Consider an infinitesimal rotation for these three rotation operators. To second order in theta, Calculate the commutator of the first two infinitesimal rotation operators to second order in theta: To second order, the commutator of infinitesimal rotations of rotations about the first two axes equals twice one rotation about the third axis given the squared angle minus a zero rotation about an arbitrary axis (a fancy way to say the identity). Now I want to write this result using anti-automorphic involutions for the small rotation operators. Nothing has changed. Repeat this exercise one last time for the first conjugate: This points exactly the opposite way,even for an infinitesimal angle! This is the kernel required to form a unified representation of integral and half integral spin. Imagine adding up a series of these small rotations, say 2 pi of these. No doubt the identity and conjugates will bring you back exactly where you started. The first and second conjugates in the commutator will point in the opposite direction. To get back on course will require another 2 pi, because the minus of a minus will generate a plus. Automorphic Commutator Identities This is a very specific example. Is there a general identity behind this work? Here it is: It is usually a good sign if a proposal gets more subtle by generalization :-) In this case, the negative sign seen on the z axis for the first conjugate commutator is due to the action of an additional first conjugate. For the first conjugate, the first term will have the correct sign after a 2 pi journey, but the scalar, third and forth terms will point the opposite way. A similar, but not identical story applies for the second conjugate. With the identity, we can see exactly what happens if q changes places with q' with a commutator. Notice, I stopped right at the commutator (not including any additional conjugator). In that case: Under an exchange, the identity and conjugate commutators form a distinct group from the commutators formed with the first and second conjugates. The behavior in a commutator under exchange of the identity automorphism and the anti-automorphic conjugate are identical. The first and second conjugates are similar, but not identical. There are also corresponding identities for the anti-commutator: At this point, I don't know how to use them, but again, the identity and first conjugates appear to behave differently that the first and second conjugates. Implications This is not a super-symmetric proposal. For that work, there is a super- partner particle for every currently detected particle. At this time, not one of those particles has been detected, a serious omission. Three different operators had to be blended together to perform this feat: commutators, conjugates and rotations. These involve issue of even/oddness, mirrors, and rotations. In a commutator under exchange of two quaternions, the identity and the conjugate behave in a united way, while the first and second conjugates form a similar, but not identical set. Because this is a general quaternion identity of automorphisms, this should be very widely applicable.","title":"Spin and angular momentum"},{"location":"QM/spin_and_angular_momentum/#unifying-the-representation-of-spin-and-angular-momentum","text":"I will show how to represent both integral and half-integral spin within the same quaternion algebraic field.

The part we need to understand is the groups that describe the symmetry of the standard model. What is a group? A group has an identity, an inverse, and a binary operation (multiplication). One member of the group times another member of the group generates yet another member of the same group. This is a case where the math name is accurate: once in a group, you are always in a group. The standard model has three continuous groups that characterize three of the four known fundamental forces of nature. The simplest group is known as U(1) and governs electromagnetism via the photon. The reason there is one photon is that the Lie algebra u(1) - note that was a small u! - has one degree of freedom. This group is called the unary group , complex numbers with a norm of 1. The members of this group commute, so it does not matter the order things are written in. Quaternions have this property only when all point in the same or opposite directions, which is the case for when using one quaternion times itself. The continuous group SU(2) rules the weak force, the stuff driving radioactive decay. Mathematically this is call unitary quaternions, quaternions with a norm of 1. The Lie algebra used to generate this group has three degrees of freedom. That is why the weak force is mediated by three particles, the W+, W-, and the Z. The group SU(3) is for the strong force whose residual interactions keep nuclei together. Its Lie algebra has eight members, and there are eight gluons. Animations of Groups Start with a simple picture, layer pictures together, and we will be able to see what the standard model of particle physics looks like. S0 - So simple! This is the symmetry of +/-R, one number. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is This is (-1, 0, 0, 0) and (+1, 0, 0, 0). It sits in the center, as quaternions of the form (n, 0, 0, 0) like to do. [S1 - The Circle](http://www.theworld.com/%7Esweetser/quaternions/quantum /standard_model/S1) Now we let the sum of squares of 2 numbers equal 1. This creates a circle. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is The circle could have any orientation in 3D space. The program choose one at random. S2 - Slice of an Expanding/Contracting Sphere The sum of squares of 3 numbers equal 1. A quaternion has four numbers. One approach to representing S2 is to set t=0. You get the standard sphere, but only at the instant of t=0. Blink! What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is That looks like a typical sphere, except it doesn't last long. Three straight lines appear in the \"what was\" graph because time is fixed. Another way to represent S2 is to set x=0. Then you have an edge view of an expanding circle. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Only the \"what was left/right\" graph has a fixed, straight line graph, because x=0. If z=0, at least you can see the \"circleness\" What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is In the \"what was\" graphs, it is easy to spot which dimension is set to zero: it is the straight line. S3 - A Quaternion Sphere Now use all 4 terms, and fill in the sphere in both time and space! What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is SU(2) - Like S2, the Partial Sphere The graphs of S2 were all paper thin or fleeting. They do not \"fill up\" spacetime. The next graph, generated by putting random quaternions into the expression exp(q-q*), fills up spacetime. What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Although more of spacetime appears filled, only places were time is greater than zero have a chance to have an event. U(1)xSU(2) - Like the Complete Quaternion Sphere S3 SU(2) has only three of the four degrees of freedom available to a quaternion. There is no way to fill up all of spacetime with just SU(2). Now fill spacetime in by multiplying by itself, or q/|q| exp(q-q*) What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Most of the points cluster on the negative side of the time line. U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) - The Standard Model The question is how to generate SU(3)? It has a Lie algebra su(3) that has eight elements. Based on work done on quaternion quantum mechanics, it is clear I need to work with the conjugate of one quaternion times another, what I call the Euclidean product, because q q generates the norm of a quaternion q, (t2 + x2 + y2 + z2, 0, 0, 0). If we have 2 different quaternions, q and q', we can write them as q q' as U(1)xSU(2): (q/|q| exp(q-q )) (q'/|q'| exp(q'-q' )). Here is its animation: What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Notice how all of spacetime is filled evenly with events. A product of two quaternions that uses a conjugate different from a standard product because multiplication is no longer associative ((a b) c does not equal a (b c)). The norms are preserved, so the norm will remain 1. Eight independent number are used to make something with a norm of one. The identity is 1, and all elements have an inverse under what I call \"Euclidean multiplication\", q q'. Based on the animation, the group is compact and simply connected. All of this traits contribute to the conclusion that the symmetry of the standard model can be represented by quaternions in this way. It would be great to include gravity, which is all about how measurements change as one moves around a differentiable 4D manifold. Include the metric as part of the calculation of a quaternion product. The group Diff(M) is all diffeomorphisms of a compact smooth manifold. It is at the heart of general relativity. One can imagine this spacetime filling sphere on any compact smooth manifold. What happens if q=q'? That is shown below: What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is The standard model is about the group symmetry of the quaternion multiplication identity in spacetime. OK, but what does that mean? Here is my take. Observers sit at here-now in spacetime, or numerically at (0, 0, 0, 0). An observer sees something out there, and tries to characterize the \"thingie\". The basic bit of information it can classify is an event. Whatever set of events is collected, they are all tied up in describing this one thingie out there. Every event contributes to the description of the thingie, and so makes a group. The multiplicative identity of a quaternion, (1, 0, 0, 0) is a way to represent the thingie. Almost none of the events map to (1, 0, 0, 0). The events are scattered all around spacetime. U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) is the way to cow-rope all the events and bring them home, while remaining part of the same group, the one thing being observed.","title":"An Introduction to the Standard Model"},{"location":"QM/standard_model_symmetries.book/#an-introduction-to-the-standard-model","text":"The Standard Model of physics was developed in the 1970's to explain the ~270 different types of particles seen in colliders (a general introduction is available on wikipedia , and a one page cheat sheet ).

Based on work done on quaternion quantum mechanics, it is clear I need to work with the conjugate of one quaternion times another, what I call the Euclidean product, because q q generates the norm of a quaternion q, (t2 + x2 + y2 + z2, 0, 0, 0). If we have 2 different quaternions, q and q', we can write them as q q' as U(1)xSU(2): (q/|q| exp(q-q )) (q'/|q'| exp(q'-q' )). Here is its animation: What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- | | | | What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is Notice how all of spacetime is filled evenly with events. A product of two quaternions that uses a conjugate different from a standard product because multiplication is no longer associative ((a b) c does not equal a (b c)). The norms are preserved, so the norm will remain 1. Eight independent number are used to make something with a norm of one. The identity is 1, and all elements have an inverse under what I call \"Euclidean multiplication\", q q'. Based on the animation, the group is compact and simply connected. All of this traits contribute to the conclusion that the symmetry of the standard model can be represented by quaternions in this way. It would be great to include gravity, which is all about how measurements change as one moves around a differentiable 4D manifold. Include the metric as part of the calculation of a quaternion product. The group Diff(M) is all diffeomorphisms of a compact smooth manifold. It is at the heart of general relativity. One can imagine this spacetime filling sphere on any compact smooth manifold. What happens if q=q'? That is shown below: What was up/down | What is | What can be ---|---|--- | | | | What was near/far | What was left/right | What can be that is The standard model is about the group symmetry of the quaternion multiplication identity in spacetime. OK, but what does that mean? Here is my take. Observers sit at here-now in spacetime, or numerically at (0, 0, 0, 0). An observer sees something out there, and tries to characterize the \"thingie\". The basic bit of information it can classify is an event. Whatever set of events is collected, they are all tied up in describing this one thingie out there. Every event contributes to the description of the thingie, and so makes a group. The multiplicative identity of a quaternion, (1, 0, 0, 0) is a way to represent the thingie. Almost none of the events map to (1, 0, 0, 0). The events are scattered all around spacetime. U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) is the way to cow-rope all the events and bring them home, while remaining part of the same group, the one thing being observed.","title":"Visualizing the standard model"},{"location":"QM/standard_model_symmetries/#an-introduction-to-the-standard-model","text":"The Standard Model of physics was developed in the 1970's to explain the ~270 different types of particles seen in colliders (a general introduction is available on wikipedia , and a one page cheat sheet ). The part we need to understand is the groups that describe the symmetry of the standard model. What is a group? A group has an identity, an inverse, and a binary operation (multiplication). One member of the group times another member of the group generates yet another member of the same group. This is a case where the math name is accurate: once in a group, you are always in a group. The standard model has three continuous groups that characterize three of the four known fundamental forces of nature. The simplest group is known as U(1) and governs electromagnetism via the photon. The reason there is one photon is that the Lie algebra u(1) - note that was a small u! - has one degree of freedom. This group is called the unary group , complex numbers with a norm of 1. The members of this group commute, so it does not matter the order things are written in. Quaternions have this property only when all point in the same or opposite directions, which is the case for when using one quaternion times itself. The continuous group SU(2) rules the weak force, the stuff driving radioactive decay. Mathematically this is call unitary quaternions, quaternions with a norm of 1. The Lie algebra used to generate this group has three degrees of freedom. That is why the weak force is mediated by three particles, the W+, W-, and the Z. The group SU(3) is for the strong force whose residual interactions keep nuclei together. Its Lie algebra has eight members, and there are eight gluons.","title":"An Introduction to the Standard Model"},{"location":"QM/standard_model_symmetries/#animations-of-groups","text":"Start with a simple picture, layer pictures together, and we will be able to see what the standard model of particle physics looks like.","title":"Animations of Groups"},{"location":"QM/standard_model_symmetries/#s0-so-simple","text":"This is the symmetry of +/-R, one number.

If the operator A hat is an observable, then the quaternion A is a real number, (a, 0). This will commute with any quaternion. This equation is functionally equivalent to an eigenvalue equation, with A hat as an eigenvector of q and (a, 0) as the eigenvalue. However, all of the components of this equation are quaternions, not separate structures such as an operator belonging to a group and a vector. This might make a subtle but significant difference for the mathematical structure of the theory, a point that will not be investigated here. Define a linear operator B hat that multiplies q by the quaternion B. If B hat is an observable, then this operator can be defined in terms of the scalar variable a. Operators A and B are linear. Calculate the commutator [A, B], which involves the scalar a and the derivative with respect to a.

The unit vector I could also be viewed as the product of two quaternions.For classical quantum mechanics, this additional complication is unnecessary. It may be required for relativistic quantum mechanics, so this should be kept in mind. A point of clarification on notation:the same letter will be used 4 distinct ways.There are operators, A hat, which act on a quaternion wave function by multiplying by a quaternion, capital A. If the operator A hat is an observable, then it generates a real number, (a, 0), which commutes with all quaternions, whatever their form. There is also a variable with respect to a component of a quaternion, a_i, that can be used to form a differential operator. Define a linear operator A hat that multiplies q by the quaternion A. If the operator A hat is an observable, then the quaternion A is a real number, (a, 0). This will commute with any quaternion. This equation is functionally equivalent to an eigenvalue equation, with A hat as an eigenvector of q and (a, 0) as the eigenvalue. However, all of the components of this equation are quaternions, not separate structures such as an operator belonging to a group and a vector. This might make a subtle but significant difference for the mathematical structure of the theory, a point that will not be investigated here. Define a linear operator B hat that multiplies q by the quaternion B. If B hat is an observable, then this operator can be defined in terms of the scalar variable a. Operators A and B are linear. Calculate the commutator [A, B], which involves the scalar a and the derivative with respect to a. The commutator acting on a quaternion is equivalent to multiplying that quaternion by the normalized 3-vector I. The Uncertainty Principle Use these operators to construct things that behave like averages (expectation values) and standard deviations. The scalar a--generated by the observable operator A hat acting on the normalized q--can be calculated using the Euclidean product. It is hard to shuffle quaternions or their operators around. Real scalars commute with any quaternion and are their own conjugates. Operators that generate such scalars can move around. Look at ways to express the expectation value of A. Define a new operator A' based on A whose expectation value is always zero. Define the square of the operator in a way designed to link up with the standard deviation. An identical set of tools can be defined for B. In the section on bracket notation, the Schwarz inequality for quaternions was shown. The Schwarz inequality applies to quaternions, not quaternion operators. If the operators A' and B' are surrounded on both sides by q and q*, then they will behave like scalars. The left-hand side of the Schwarz inequality can be rearranged to form a commutator. The right-hand side of the Schwarz inequality can be rearranged to form the square of the standard deviation operators. Plug both of these back into the Schwarz inequality, stripping the primes and the q's which appear on both sides along the way. This is the uncertainty principle for complementary observable operators. Connections to Standard Notation This quaternion exercise can be mapped to the standard notation used in physics One subtlety to note is that a quaternion operator is anti-Hermitian only if the scalar is zero. This is probably the case for classical quantum mechanics, but quantum field theory may require full quaternion operators. The proof of the uncertainty principle shown here is independent of this issue. I do not yet understand the consequence of this point. To get to the position-momentum uncertainty equation, make these specific maps The product of the squares of the standard deviation for position and momentum in the x-direction has a lower bound equal to half the expectation value of the commutator of those operators. The proof is in the structure of quaternions. Implications There are many interpretations of the uncertainty principle. I come away with two strange observations. First, the uncertainty principle is about quaternions of the form q = Exp[a b I]. With this insight, one can see by inspection that a plane wave Exp[((Et - P.X)/hbar I], or wave packets that are superpositions of plane waves, will have four uncertainty relations, one for the scalar Et and another three for the three-part scalar P.X. This perspective should be easy to generalize. Second, the uncertainty principle and gravity are related to the same mathematical properties. This proof of the uncertainty relation involved the Schwarz inequality. It is fairly straightforward to convert that inequality to the triangle inequality. Finding geodesics with quaternions involves the triangle inequality. If a complete theory of gravity can be built from these geodesics (it hasn't yet been done :-) then the inequalities may open connections where none appeared before.","title":"Commutators and the uncertainty principle"},{"location":"QM/uncertainty_principle/#commutators-and-the-uncertainty-principle","text":"Commutators and the uncertainty principle are central to quantum mechanics.

Solve this problem TWICE, once using the Earth as a reference frame and then using the rocket at the reference frame. A: (a) From the Earth frame, we are given the proper time on the rocket clock as 30'. This interval is equal to the one seen by the Earth, which is calculated by squaring the quaternion and solving for t. The time on the Earth clock is 50 min. (b) Multiply the time by the speed and get the units right. The distance is 7.2 x meters.

(d) Find the intersection of the world line of the rocket, x/c = v t/c, and the world line of the light emitted from the Earth at 90 min, x/c = t - 90'. The position of the event is 450' v/c = 360'. We need the proper time of this interval, which will be the time on the rocket clock. At 4:30 rocket time, the light from the Earth will be received at the rocket. A': Now from the rocket frame... (a') From the rocket frame, we are given t=30', x = 0. We need to boost this proper time interval to the Earth's frame. The time in the Earth frame is 50 min. (b') The distance from the Earth in the Earth's frame is the second term of the above quaternion. Convert 40 min to meters. The distance is 7.2 x meters. (c') Find the intersection of the world line of the Earth, x/c = -v t/c, and the light emitted at 30', x/c = -t + 30. The position of this event is 150' v/c = 120'. We need the proper time of this interval, which will be the time on the Earth clock. At 1:30 Earth time, the light will be received from the rocket. (d') It is 150' in the rocket frame when the Earth emits the signal. It will take 120' for the signal to arrive. 150' + 120' = 270' or 4:30. The same answer again!

Subtract the distance traveled by the nose from the tail. Take the ratio of this difference with the rest length. The ratio of lengths as seen on the Earth is 1 minus this small number. (b) We want to know the differential time between a boosted clock and one at rest. This is the first term of the difference between a boosted and unboosted clock. Set this equal to 1 microsecond and solve for t. The plane must travel for 4.53x10^5 s to get out of sync by a microsecond with the Earth, or 5.25 days. R & H: 2-21 Travel to the galactic center! Q: (a) Can a person, in principle, travel from Earth to the galactic center (which is about 28,000 lyr distant) in a normal lifetime? (b) What constant velocity would be needed to make the trip in 30 years (proper time)? A: (b) Boost the rocketeer up to the BIG speed B=1-e, set the distance to the destination d, and solve for e. Plug in numbers. The constant speed required to make the trip in 30 years is 1 - 5.7 x 10^-7 less than c. The answer to (a) is that as a purely mathematical exercise, one could say yes. However, this does not account for the energy required to reach such a speed. An analysis which investigated the energy requirements would probably conclude that it cannot be done. R & H: 2-24 Decay in flight (II) Q: The mean lifetime of muons stopped in a lead block in the laboratory is measured to be 2.2 microseconds. The mean lifetime of high-speed muons in a burst of cosmic rays observed from the Earth is measured to be 16 microseconds. Find the speed of these cosmic ray muons. A: Boost the muon from its rest frame to the lab. Set the time component of the quaternion equal to 16 microseconds. The muon is travelling 0.9905 c. R & H: 2-25 Decay in flight (III) Q: An unstable high-energy particle enters a detector and leaves a track 1.05 mm long before it decays. Its speed relative to the detector was 0.992c. What is its proper lifetime? A: Boost the proper path of unknown length L by v/c = 0.992, solve for L given the lab length L'. The average lifetime is 4.4 x s. R & H: 2-26 Decay in flight (IV) Q: In the target area of an accelerator laboratory there is a straight evacuated tube 300 m long. A momentary burst of 1 million radioactive particles enters at one end of the tube, moving at a speed of 0.80c. Half of them arrive at the other end wi thout having decayed. (a) How long is the tube as measured by an observer moving with the particles? (b) What is the half- life of the particles in this same reference frame? (c) With what speed is the tube measured to move in this frame? A: (a) Same as above. The tube looks 180 m long to the moving particles. (b) The length of the target is equal to one half life, t = L/v. The half life is 750 nanoseconds. (c) By symmetry, v = 0.8c. By calculation. The tube looks like it is moving 0.8c in the rest frame of the particles. R & H: 2-28 Simultaneous - but to whom? Q: An experimenter arranges to trigger two flashbulbs simultaneously, a blue flash located at the origin of his reference frame and a red flash at x = 30 km. A second observer is moving at a speed of 0.25c in the direction of increasing x, and also v iews these flashes. (a) What time interval between them does he find? (b) Which flash does he say occurs first? A: (a) For the first observer, the blue flash stays at the origin. The red flash is boosted to a new location in spacetime. There will be 26 microseconds between the flashes. (b) The origin won't change under the boost. From part (a) the flash of red light event will be changed to -26 microseconds. Therefore the red light appears first to the rocketeer. R & H: 2-36 What time is it anyway? Q: Observers S and S' stand at the origins of their respective frames, which are moving relative to each other with a speed of 0.6c. Each has a standard clock, which, as usual, they set to zero when the two origins coincide. Observer S keeps the S' clock visually in sight. (a) What time will the S' clock record when the S clock records 5 microseconds? (b) What time will observer S actually read on the S' clock when his own clock reads 5 microseconds? A: (a) We must determine the proper time for a clock with t = 5 microseconds, and x = v t, by taking the square root of the first term of the event quaternion squared. The S' clock will record 4 microseconds when the clock in S reaches 5 microseconds. (b) The intersection of the worldline of the rocket, x/c = 0.6 t and a lightcone passing through t = 5 microseconds, x = 0 can be solved for t. The S' clock will read the interval of the quaternion at this intersection. Calculate the interval as in part (a). At 5 microseconds, the observer in frame S will actually see 2.5 microseconds on the S' clock. Baranger: The cat's life Q: A newborn cat is put aboard a ship leaving Earth for Andromeda at speed v = 0.6c. The cat dies on the ship at age 7 years. (a) How far from the Earth in the Earth's frame is the ship when the cat dies? (b) A radio signal is sent from the ship wh en the cat dies. When does this signal get to the Earth by Earth time? (c) Bonus: What is the probability amplitude that Schr\u00f6dinger killed the cat? A: (a) The proper time of the cat's life is 7 years. Boost it to the Earth's frame. In the Earth's frame, the cat died after traveling a distance equal to 5.25 years. (b) It will take 5.25 years for the light to get back from the time when the cat died (8.75 years), so the signal reaches Earth in 5.25 + 8.75 = 14 years. (c) Schr\u00f6dinger posed the question as a joke. He is definitely still laughing. Baranger: A particle's life Q: A particle moving with speed v = 0.99c goes on the average a distance 12.5 m before decaying. What is its proper lifetime? A: Take the lifetime of the particle in its own frame, boost it to the lab's frame. In the lab, x = 12 m. Set them equal, solve for the lifetime. The lifetime is 5.7 ns. Baranger: Trains & clocks Q: The train is moving with a velocity v. At the head of the train, the engineer compares her clock C'1 with a stationary clock C1 outside as she passes it, and finds that both clocks read time zero. At the same moment (for the train frame) the cond uctor in the caboose compares his clock C'2 (which therefore also reads zero) with a stationary clock C2 he happens to be passing. What does C2 read? The distance between the clocks C'1 and C'2 measured by people on the train is L. A: The interval for both sets of clocks is L/C. For the observer on the ground, set the time to t, the distance to vt/c. Square this quaternion, set the first term equal to the square of the interval, and solve for t. The clock will read . Note that Mathematica has erroneously injected a factor of I into the \"solution\". Baranger: Blow up the Earth Q: Some inhabitants of the Andromeda nebula are traveling through the Milky Way in a flying saucer whose constant velocity equals 0.8c. Going by the Earth, they find out that it is A. D. 1996 here and they synchronize their clocks with ours. In A. D . 2005, mankind blows up the Earth. At what time, on their clock, do the travellers in the flying saucer learn of this event, assuming that they have been watching us all along through a telescope. Try a few ways of doing this problem. A: From the frame of the Earth, find the intersection of the world line of the saucer, x/c = 0.8 t, and the light cone from the explosion of the Earth, x/c = t + 9 yr. The saucer has travelled a distance d = v t. Calculate the interval which will give the saucer's proper time. In 27 years time, or 2023, the saucer will note the demise of Earth. A': Repeat the calculation from the saucer frame. We know the interval is 9 years. The position will be x = v t = 12 years, which will take another twelve years to return, for a total of 27 years. Initialization functions There are a few tools required to solve problems in special relativity using quaternions to characterize events in spacetime. The most basic are a round value for c and gamma. Define a function for quaternions using its matrix representation. A quaternion L that transforms a quaternion (L q[ x ] = q[ x' ]) identical to how the Lorentz transformation acts on 4-vectors (Lambda x = x' ) should exist. These are described in detail in the notebook \"A different al gebra for boosts.\" For boosts along the x axis with y = z = 0, the general function for L is Most of the problems here involve much simpler cases for L, where t or x is zero, or t is equal to x.

Baranger: The ladder in the barn Q: (long) Manuel wants to demonstrate the Lorentz length contraction by fitting his 10 m ladder inside his 8 m garage. He ties the ladder on top of his station wagon and asks his friend Linda to drive the wagon into the open door of the garage. Linda drives it at the speed of 0.8c, than therefore gamma = 5/3, which makes the ladder only 6 m long. Manuel is standing by the door and, as soon as the rear end of the ladder has passed, he shuts the door. He now has the entire ladder inside the 8 m garage, just as he said he would. However, this garage also has a back door and, since the brakes on the wagon are a little worn out, Manuel has instructed his other friend Gwen to open the back door at the precise instant that the front end of the ladder is about to hit it. It's OK, says Manuel, because the ladder was actually inside the garage, with both doors shut, for a finite amount of time, and that is all he wanted to prove. But it turns out that Gwen's cat, CloudNine, was sitting all the time on the ladder on top of the wagon, and CloudNine disagrees totally. He says: the ladder was really 10 m, while the garage was Lorentz contracted and only 8 m x 3/5 = 4.8 m, and obviously that the ladder was never, never totally inside the garage. CloudNine looks in good health; the ladder is still in one piece. What's going on? Who is right? INSTRUCTIONS: Define 4 separate events. Choose coordinates in two frames. Elaborate the 2 descriptions of what happened, Manuel's and CloudNine's, giving precise numbers for all the events. Show that these two descriptions are actually totally consistent, given the known laws of special relativity. A. From the viewpoint of the barn, the ladder is contracted. This involves boosting the end of the ladder, and subtracting where the start of the ladder has moved to at a simultaneous time. Manuel observes (correctly) that the ladder appears to be length contracted to 6 m in his reference frame. Repeat this exercise for the cat frame looking at the length of the barn. The barn is only 4.8m long from the cat's reference frame. Manuel and the cat make correct statements about length contraction from their own reference frames. What makes this problem confusing to discuss is that the doors of the barn and the ends of the ladder are spacelike separated, so the order of events in time can be reversed depending on the reference frame. The reference event chosen for the following spacetime diagrams (created in the program Spacetime by Prof. Edwin F. Taylor) is Manuel meeting the start of the ladder. The end of the barn and the end of the ladder must be located on invariant hyperbolae 8 and 10 meters long respectively. Gwen must open the door somewhere on the barn's 8 meter hyperbola. Manuel's dream will only come true if the reference event and the two ends are not separated by Gwen's action. This is not the case as seen in the figure below: Gwen always opens the far barn door before both ends of the ladder and barn are together with Manuel and the start of the ladder, averting disaster. The barn stays in one piece and we have had fun with moving objects with spacelike separations. R&H: 2-34 2 flashes at different places - or are they?

He measures the time interval between the occurrences of the flashes to be 5 microseconds, the red flash occurring first. (a) What is the relative velocity v of a second observer S' who would record these flashes as occurring at the same place? (b) From the point of view of S', which flash occurs first? (c) What time between them would S' measure? A: (a) Boost both red and blue lights by beta into frame S'. Set the distances equal to each other (the second components of the boosted quaternions) and solve. The second observer moves toward the first observer at a relative speed of 0.48c. (b) Substitute the value for v/c into the boosted time for the events. The red light happens first for observer S'. (c) Calculate the difference between the first two components of the quaternions. The time difference is 4.39 microseconds. Addition of velocities If a quaternion is normalized to its interval, it becomes: If a quaternion is normalized to its interval and the first term which is gamma, the result is a quaternion characterizing the velocities: This quaternion can be formed from any quaternion and boosted accordingly. For this series of problems, we need a more general boost quaternion, one where y and z are not zero. Define the function Lambda to do the general boost along x. R&H: 2-59 Watching the decay of a moving nucleus Q: A radioactive nucleus moves with a uniform velocity of 0.050c along the x axis of a reference frame S fixed with respect to the laboratory. It decays by emitting an electron whose speed, measured in a reference frame S' moving with the nucleus, is 0.80c. Consider first the case in which the emitted electron travels (a) along the common x-x' axis and (b) along the y' axis and find, for each case, its velocity as measured in frame S. (c) Suppose, however, that the emitted electron, viewed now from frame S, travels along the y axis of that frame with a speed of 0.80c. What is its velocity as measured in frame S'? A: (a) Boost the velocity quaternion by -0.05c, and keep it as a velocity quaternion by normalizing it with the resulting gamma. The relative velocity in frame S is 0.817c along the x axis. (b) Do that again, with y = 0.8. The magnitude and angle of the velocity vector can be calculated. The velocity vector is 0.8005c 3.58 degrees to the right of the y axis. (c) Repeat the calculation, switching the sign of the boost. A similar quaternion to b, so the velocity vector is 0.80056c, but 3.57 degrees to the left of the y axis. Baranger: Boosting boosted frames Q: (a) Frame S' moves with respect to frame S with velocity beta1 in the +x direction. Frame S'' moves with respect to frame S' with velocity beta2 also in the + x direction. Frame S\" moves with respect to frame S with velocity Beta, also in the +x direction. Let gamma1, gamma2, and Gamma be the 3 Lorentz factors corresponding to these 3 velocities, respectively. Prove the formula (b) 2 identical particles are having a head-on collision. In their center-of- mass frame, each has a Lorentz factor gamma. Assume gamma >> 1. Now look at them in the Lab frame in which one of them is at rest, and call Gamma the Lorentz factor of the projectile particle. Show that Gamma is approximately equal to . A: (a) From the reference frame of S', beta1 is towards it (so is negative) and beta2 is away from S' (so it is positive). The first term is the gamma being sought. Note that the second term divided by the first term gives the expected addition of relative velocities for frame S'. The sign is opposite for frame S. (b) If gamma >> 1, use the approximation for beta of one minus epsilon, where epsilon is a small number. Plug into the results from part (a). Square gamma. Substitute back into Gamma big. Gamma for the projectile particle is the first term of the above quaternion, approximately . French: 5-7 2 ways to double a boost Q: An inertial system S1 has a constant velocity v1 along the x axis relative to an inertial system S. Inertial system S2 has a velocity v2 relative to S1. Two successive Lorentz transformations enable up to go from (t, x, y, z) to (t1, x1, y1, z1) and then from (t1, x1, y1, z1) to (t2, x2, y2, z2). Show that this gives the same result as a single Lorentz transformation from (t, x, y, z) to (t2, x2, y2, z2) provided we take the velocity of S1 relative to S as . A: Boost once, then again. Now boost once using the addition of velocities rule. These two quaternions are identical, as expected. Initialization functions There are a few tools required to solve problems in special relativity using quaternions to characterize events in spacetime. The most basic are a round value for c and gamma. Define a function for quaternions using its matrix representation. A quaternion L that transforms a quaternion (L q[ x ] = q[ x' ]) identical to how the Lorentz transformation acts on 4-vectors (Lambda x = x' ) should exist. These are described in detail in the notebook \"A different algebra for boosts.\" For boosts along the x axis with y = z = 0, the general function for L is Most of the problems here involve much simpler cases for L, where t or x is zero, or t is equal to x. If t = 0, then If x = 0, then If t = x, then Note: this is for redshifts. Blueshifts have a plus instead of the minus.

He ties the ladder on top of his station wagon and asks his friend Linda to drive the wagon into the open door of the garage. Linda drives it at the speed of 0.8c, than therefore gamma = 5/3, which makes the ladder only 6 m long. Manuel is standing by the door and, as soon as the rear end of the ladder has passed, he shuts the door. He now has the entire ladder inside the 8 m garage, just as he said he would. However, this garage also has a back door and, since the brakes on the wagon are a little worn out, Manuel has instructed his other friend Gwen to open the back door at the precise instant that the front end of the ladder is about to hit it. It's OK, says Manuel, because the ladder was actually inside the garage, with both doors shut, for a finite amount of time, and that is all he wanted to prove. But it turns out that Gwen's cat, CloudNine, was sitting all the time on the ladder on top of the wagon, and CloudNine disagrees totally. He says: the ladder was really 10 m, while the garage was Lorentz contracted and only 8 m x 3/5 = 4.8 m, and obviously that the ladder was never, never totally inside the garage. CloudNine looks in good health; the ladder is still in one piece. What's going on? Who is right? INSTRUCTIONS: Define 4 separate events. Choose coordinates in two frames. Elaborate the 2 descriptions of what happened, Manuel's and CloudNine's, giving precise numbers for all the events. Show that these two descriptions are actually totally consistent, given the known laws of special relativity. A. From the viewpoint of the barn, the ladder is contracted. This involves boosting the end of the ladder, and subtracting where the start of the ladder has moved to at a simultaneous time. Manuel observes (correctly) that the ladder appears to be length contracted to 6 m in his reference frame. Repeat this exercise for the cat frame looking at the length of the barn. The barn is only 4.8m long from the cat's reference frame. Manuel and the cat make correct statements about length contraction from their own reference frames. What makes this problem confusing to discuss is that the doors of the barn and the ends of the ladder are spacelike separated, so the order of events in time can be reversed depending on the reference frame. The reference event chosen for the following spacetime diagrams (created in the program Spacetime by Prof. Edwin F. Taylor) is Manuel meeting the start of the ladder. The end of the barn and the end of the ladder must be located on invariant hyperbolae 8 and 10 meters long respectively. Gwen must open the door somewhere on the barn's 8 meter hyperbola. Manuel's dream will only come true if the reference event and the two ends are not separated by Gwen's action. This is not the case as seen in the figure below: Gwen always opens the far barn door before both ends of the ladder and barn are together with Manuel and the start of the ladder, averting disaster. The barn stays in one piece and we have had fun with moving objects with spacelike separations.","title":"Baranger: The ladder in the barn"},{"location":"SR/problem_set_3/#rh-2-34-2-flashes-at-different-places-or-are-they","text":"Q: An observer S sees a flash of red light 1200 m from his position and a flash of blue light 720 m closer to him and on the same straight line.

(a) Calculate the expected wavelength for light emitted from the forward-moving (approaching) atoms, using the exact relativistic formula. (b) By using a mirror this same spectrometer can also measure the wavelength of light emitted by these moving atoms in the direction opposite to their motion. What wavelength is expected under this arrangement? (c) Calculate the difference between the average of the two wavelengths found in (a) and (b) and the unshifted (proper) wavelength. Find the second order dependence on beta. By this technique, Ives and Stillwell were able to distinguish between the predictions of the classical and the relativistic Doppler formulas.

In event 2, this particle decays 5 meters away. Is the interval between these two events timelike or spacelike? Why? A: The speed of the particle must be less than one, or x/t < 1. If event 1 is at the origin and event 2 has a spatial position of 5m, it must have a time of 5m + a (a>0). Calculate the square of the interval by squaring the quaternion. The square of the interval a^2 + 10a is always positive, so the interval is timelike in the future. R&H: 2-42 The interval is invariant - check it out Q: Two events occur on the x axis of reference frame S, their spacetime coordinates being event1 = q[5 us, 720 m,0,0 ] and event 2 = [2 us, 1200 m,0,0 ].

Calculate the square of the interval in this frame and compare it to the value calculated for frame S. (c) What are the coordinates of these events in a frame S\" that moves at a speed of 0.95c in the direction of decreasing x? Again calculate the square of the spacetime interval and compare it with the values found in (a) and (b). Do your calculations bear out the invariance of the spacetime interval? A: (a) The square of the spacetime interval between events 1 and 2 is the first term of difference between the quaternions squared. The square of the interval between event 1 and 2 is 5.8 x 10 5 m 2. (b) Boost the quaternions and then square them. The square of the interval between the boosted events is the same. (c) Repeat the exercise with a new value for beta. Again, the square of the interval between the boosted events is the same. The first term of the square of a quaternion is identical to the first term of a square of a boosted quaternion.

(d) Can you calculate a (mathematically real) proper time interval for this pair of events? (e) Would you describe this pair of events as timelike? Spacelike? Lightlike? A: (a) The square of the spacetime interval between events 1 and 2 is the first term of difference between the quaternions squared. The square of the interval between event 1 and 2 is -1.9 x 10 5 m 2 (b) The proper distance interval is the square root of the negative of this number. The proper distance is 436 m. (c) Boost both event quaternions by beta, set the time components equal to each other, and solve for beta.

(a) Using the data from problem 2-42 above, calculate the proper time interval for this pair of events. The proper time interval that you have calculated should be smaller than any of the actual time intervals in the three given frames of problem 2-42. Is it? (b) If two events possess a (mathematically real) proper time interval, it should be possible to find a frame S' in which these events would be seen to occur at the same place. Find this frame. (c) Can you calculate a (mathematically real) proper distance interval for this pair of events? (d) Would you describe this pair of events as timelike? Spacelike? Lightlike? A: (a) To make this question more of a challenge, let's define a quaternion \"Ltau\" which maps an arbitrary timelike quaternion to its proper time: Ltau . q[t,x,y,z] = q[tau, 0, 0, 0] . To find Ltau, multiply the above equation on the right by the inverse of q[t,x,y,z]. Works to within default accuracy. Now on to the question. Map the given quaternion to its proper time interval. The proper time is 2.54 microseconds. This is less than the time of 3 microseconds observed in this frame. Boost the interval up 0.6c, & repeat the cycle. The interval 2.53 microseconds is the same, less that 4.95 microseconds observed. The interval is the same, less that 4.74 microseconds observed. (b) Boost both event quaternions by beta, set the space components equal to each other, and solve for beta. The frame must move a speed 0.53c in the direction of decreasing x. (c) & (d) The interval is timelike. It is not meaningful to search for a proper distance between these two events.

Alas, he miscalculated slightly and he returns to the tree just barely behind her! QUESTION: Assuming that the two animals were of the same age before the race, which one is older at the end of it? Justify your answer with quantitative arguments! A: Let the hare run the fraction f of the tortoise's proper time t. Calculate the tortoise's squared interval in terms of this fraction. In the tortoise's reference frame, the hare initially travels away from the tortoise at the slow Btort speed for time t. Then the hare starts traveling toward the tortoise at Bhare speed for a time (1-f) t. Calculate the hare's squared interval. Look at the difference. Since this term is always negative, the hare is necessarily younger than the tortoise. R&H: B2-2 Einstein and the clock \"paradox\" Q: Einstein, in his first paper on the special theory of relativity, wrote the following: \"If one of the two synchronous clocks at A is moved in a closed curve with constant velocity until it returns to A, the journey lasting t seconds, then by the clock that has remained at rest the travelled clock on its arrival at A will be t v 2/2 c 2 seconds slow.\" Prove this statement. (Note: Elsewhere in his paper Einstein indicated that this result is an approximation, valid only for v << c.) A: Compare the intervals of the two clocks, one that has move, the other that has remained. If beta << 1, calculate the series expansion. The moving clock is t v 2/2 c 2 slower than the one at rest. R&H B2-12: Getting Younger Q: Can you think of any way to use space travel to reverse the aging process, that is, to get younger? Could you send your parents out on a long space voyage and have them be younger than you are when they get back? A: There are actually two questions here. Starting with the last question first, with a HUGE investment of energy for the parents, time will appear to run at a slower rate than the clocks back at home. The energy investment is the critical parameter to determine if the clocks will run at different enough rates to have the parents return younger than their children. The second question concerns reversing the aging process. The aging process will appear to procede in the same manor for both parent and child. Why is this not reversable? Find the quaternion that reverses time. LTimeRev q[t, x, y, z] = q[-t, x, y, z] Compute LTimeRev by multiplying on the right by the inverse of q[t,x,y,z]. Aboard the spaceship, or on the Earth, t >>> x, y and z, so the time reversal quaternion is approximately Test that this works for someone moving a meter per second in the x direction, 0.5 m/s in the y. The proposed quaternion does reverse time in the classical regime. Note that it is predominantly a scalar, almost q[-1,0,0,0] However, it is not exactly the identity. If we think about time reversal for two nearby worldlines, they will not commute by the small factor found in the second through fourth terms. This observation may lead to a new justification of the second law of thermodynamics. French: 5-20 Signals from twins Q: A and B are twins. A goes on a trip to Alpha Centauri (4 light- years away) and back again. He travels at speed 0.6c with respect to the Earth both ways, and transmits a radio signal every 0.01 year in his frame. His twin B similarly sends a signal every 0.01 years in his own rest frame. (a) how many signals emitted by A before he turns around does B receive? (b) How many signals does A receive before he turns around? (c) What is the total number of signals each twin receives from the other? (d) Who is younger at the end of the trip, and by how much? Show that the twins both agree on this result. A: Start out by drawing the signals sent and received from B's frame of reference. (a) The signals from A out are redshifted and received at B for a time of ... The signals are sent at a rate of 100/year as viewed by the sender. This rate is lowered by the redshifting, so the total number of signals is the lower rate times the amount of time the signals are received. B receives 533 redshifted signals from A. (b) The signals from B are not shifted in B's frame, but are received at A for a time of... A receives 266 signals from B during A's trip to Alpha Centauri. (c) It is easiest to calculate the number of signals received by A since the rate with B as a reference frame is constant. A receives a total of 1333 signals from B. B gets blueshifted signals for a short time. The rate of signals goes way up. B receives a total of 1066 signals from A. (d) B has sent out 1333 signals, but has only received 1066 from A, so he has experienced more ticks of the clock. The difference is due to the instantaneous change of reference frame experienced by A. Initialization functions There are a few tools required to solve problems in special relativity using quaternions to characterize events in spacetime. The most basic are a round value for c and gamma. Define a function for quaternions using its matrix representation. A quaternion L that transforms a quaternion (L q[ x ] = q[ x' ]) identical to how the Lorentz transformation acts on 4- vectors (Lambda x = x' ) should exist. These are described in detail in the notebook \"A different algebra for boosts.\" For boosts along the x axis with y = z = 0, the general function for L is Most of the problems here involve much simpler cases for L, where t or x is zero, or t is equal to x. If t = 0, then If x = 0, then If t = x, then Note: this is for blueshifts. Redshifts have a plus instead of the minus.

What is the energy of the remaining pi meson? (Rest mass of K meson = 494 MeV; rest mass of pi meson ~137 MeV). A: Define the quaternions for the before and after states. The kinetic energy will be E - M = gamma M - M. The pion has 616.6 MeV of kinetic energy. Use the fact that energy is conserved to calculate the kinetic energy of the K meson. The K meson has 396.6 MeV of kinetic energy.

After the collision, these two particles are replaced by two new particles of masses m1 and m2 respectively. The total energy (including rest energy) of particle 1 is E1 = 700 MeV and its momentum is p1x = 400 MeV, p1y = 300 MeV. (a) Draw a \"before and after\" picture. (b) Find the energy and the momentum of particle 2. (c) Find the masses m1 and m2. A: (b) Lots of data is given to define the quaternions.

A: Choose to define the velocity vector in terms of the momentum vectors. Define the two quaternions. Calculate their product, looking at the first term which has units of energy. The result can be written as . There is an even easier way to express this product. This is M/E or 1/gamma. This result was due to the unusual choice of the velocity vector. Look at the other terms.

A: Determine the gammas from the kinetic energy and masses given. We can calculate the py momentum for the m140 particle. The py momentum for the m1100 must be equal and opposite, which allows a calculation of the angle. Calculate the amount of momentum in the x direction. All of this momentum is from the incoming projectile. Calculate the total energy after minus m940 to get the energy of the incoming projectile. Calculate the mass of incoming projectile the usual way by looking at the first term of the square root of the squared quaternion. The mass of the incoming projectile is 588 MeV. Initialization functions There are a few tools required to solve problems in special relativity using quaternions to characterize events in spacetime. The most basic are a round value for c and gamma. Define a function for quaternions using its matrix representation. A quaternion L that transforms a quaternion (L q[ x ] = q[ x' ]) identical to how the Lorentz transformation acts on 4- vectors (Lambda x = x' ) should exist. These are described in detail in the notebook \"A different algebra for boosts.\" For boosts along the x axis with y = z = 0, the general function for L is Most of the problems here involve much simpler cases for L, where t or x is zero, or t is equal to x.

An event in space-time has one dimension for time and three dimensions for space, the most powerful tool would be a generalized number that can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided, but has four parts to it. There is one such number called a quaternion, shown here. Time is t, and x, y, and z are the values the event may have in the three directions, i, j, and k. Quaternions are the mathematical foundation for all my efforts in theoretical physics. A person standing on a scale in a closed box could not tell the difference between the box sitting on the surface of the Earth or the box accelerating at the same rate as the Earth's gravity in a rocket ship as depicted here. Einstein called this the equivalence principle, but it only applied to mass, not charge. The General Equivalence Principle extends this idea of fooling observers to cover any measurement. The box mathematically means \"all the changes in time and space.\" One can ask, what are all the possible changes in the direction rulers (I) and the potential (A), or Box IA? The usual answer is the rulers are fixed and it is the potential that changes, I Box A. However, the answer could also be the potential is the same, but the rulers are changing, A Box I. A unified field theory describes light and gravity in the same equation. Einstein spent the last half of his life looking for one, but did not succeed. The equation on the right reads in mathlish, \"The change in the change in the potential equals some constants times the source.\" The stars are involved in games with plus and minus signs. It takes work to see that the signs are correct. A unified field theory must be able to describe all forms of change. The graphic tries to depict this: changes in a square grid, changes moving straight out from the center, changes that are circular ripples, and changes that are spirals. The graphic does not show changes in time or the third dimension. It is only a graphic after all. The standard model is used to quantify why there are this many of that kind of subatomic particle, and that many of those particles. A vast amount of exquisite detail is explained.

Newton's law of gravity works to explain the rotation of the Moon around the Earth. Newton's law of gravity works to explain the velocity of stars near the center of a galaxy, but fails to explain why stars further from the center maintain that same velocity. One hypothesis is called dark matter, stuff that cannot be seen but makes the velocities work out just so. All physics laws must respect relativity and the rules of calculus. These rules create the second term which has a constant velocity and accurately describes the distribution of mass with respect to the radius, no dark matter required.","title":"Buttons"},{"location":"Stuff/buttons.book/#buttons","text":"| | | | | -- | -- | -- | | | | | Promote the Doing Physics with Quaternions Project, and look cool :-) These 5 buttons represent a visual presentation of some of the key ideas behind my efforts to unify gravity and electromagnetism.

Note that I have spent on the order of $60k over the years doing the research required to generate the content.","title":"T-shirts and prints"},{"location":"Stuff/shop/#my-digital-books","text":"From leanpub.com, a PDR, epub, or Mobi file: Doing Physics with QUaternions , $9.99 Doing Special Relativity with Quaternions , $1.99","title":"My Digital Books"},{"location":"Stuff/shop/#amazon-books","text":"The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory: The Theoretical Minimum Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman Spacetime Physics Edwin F.
