# Maxwell by hand

![The Maxwell source equations derivation by hand](../images/EM/Maxwell_by_hand/max_1_covariant.jpg)

To really lean anything, one needs to practice over and over, by hand.  Here is
a complete derivation of the Maxwell source equations using quaternions.
Instead of picking the familiar Cartesian coordinates of _t_, _x_, _y_, and _z_,
generalized coordiantes are used with the numbers 0-3.

Copy this over until you can do so without looking at a reference image.  Leave
your practice sheets around where you work or study.  People will presume you
are a genius.
