# Problem set answers for MITs 8.033 using real valued quaternions

## The Back Story

In early 1997, I had a meeting with a famous physicist to discuss my research 
project. Actually, I sat outside his door and talked with him to and from the 
Chinese food truck. He thought my project was "Interesting, but not very 
interesting." The reason was that I had a few math widgets, but no theory. I 
thanked him for his time.

Now I had to find a theory. This is a crazy assignment. I decided to begin my 
search by posing a question: define a brief definition of time that must be two 
sentences or less and only be about physics or math, not philosophy. My run-on 
sentence answer used quaternions as a definition of events in space-time.

To test the hypothesis, I asked the professor who taught the class if I could 
audit 8.033, Classical and Relativitic Mechanics (it is now 
[online](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-033-relativity-fall-2006/)). He 
approved. As a test of quaternions as an essential tool for physics, I had 
three ground rules for the assigned problems:

1. Each problem had to be solved the standard way
1. Each problem had to be solved using real-valued quaternions
1. If any problem could not be solved with real-valued quaternions, there would 
   be no need to look further into quaternions

It turned out that all 53 assigned problems were solved using real-valued 
quaternions. That was the start of my ongoing study. To avoid the book being 
overrun with the problem set answers, they were moved to a separate book.
