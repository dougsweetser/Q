# Totally-ordered and Disordered Sets in Space-time under Lorentz Transformations

In Einstein's first paper on special relativity in 1905, he shows how
simultaneity is not an invariant under a Lorentz transformation. While there
may be an observer that says events A and B happened at the same moment in
time, a second observer may say A happened before B while a third reports B
happened before A. Is there something that all three observers can agree upon
about events A and B, that is invariant under a proper Lorentz transformation?
So long as the observers have put in the effort to agree about their choices in
coordinates and the origin, then the three observers will all agree on the
ordering in space of these events in space. If the first observer says A is
left of B, then so do observers two and three. If events A and B were in the
same location for one of the dimensions, they would remain together. A
totally-ordered set means one can say exactly one of three things about any
pair of numbers: one is bigger than the other, one is less than the other, or
both have the same value. An axis on a graph is a totally-ordered set. Here we
are thinking about pairs of space-like events that can be connected by a
straight line that runs through the origin. Under a Lorentz transformation, the
time for these pairs can switch order depending on the inertial observer
chosen. I will call this a disordered in time set of events for space-like
separated events under proper Lorentz transformations. The measurements of
space will form three totally-ordered sets.

The same exercise can be repeated for all time-like pairs events that fall on a
line running through the origin. These pairs of events will be totally-ordered
in time: event A did happen before event B and all observers agree to that. If
event A was simultaneous to event B, that will remain true for all possible
inertial observers. To be time-like, simultaneous, and be on a line through the
origin requires that the spatial location of A is identical to B. What is
disordered are measurements of space. If event A is located at the same place
as event B for one observer, a different observer could put A left of B. The
third observer may see event A to the right of B. There are three disordered in
space sets of events for time-like separated events in a straight line through
the origin under Lorentz transformations.

Pairs of light-like events remain totally-ordered in both time and the three
directions of space. Since everything in the light-cone travels at the same
speed, there is no way for one event to “catch up” and pass another. 

Here is a summary table:

| Relation to origin | Space-time component | Ordering |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| space-like | t | disordered |
|  " | X1	| totally-ordered |
| " | X2 | totally-ordered |
| " | X2 | totally-ordered |
| time-like | t | totally-ordered |
| " | X1 | disordered |
| " | X2 | disordered |
| " | X3 | disordered | 
| light-like | t | totally-ordered |
| " | X1 | totally-ordered |
| " | X2 | totally-ordered |
| " | X3 | totally-ordered |

For this summary to be valid, for all the events in the set there must exist an
inertial reference frame where all the events are on the space axis for
space-like events, on the time axis for time-like events or on the light cone
for light-like events. For any other collection of events, this analysis does
not apply. It is relevant to Einstein's initial observation about simultaneous
space-like events which fall on the space axis. I find it interesting that
events on the light cone retain their relative ordering. For different inertial
observers, there will be relativistic Doppler shifting which is
well-understood. 

Is the requirement of this analysis that for all event there exists straight
line so narrow as to make this observation uninteresting? I would argue that
every material object's world line to the material object is a straight line.
While I may bike around suburbia, I am at the center of my observable world. I
can never ride fast enough to separate from my own eyes. Everyone does agree
about which moment of my life came first, second and last. Being North or
South, East or West, and up or down would depend on the inertial observer.

While I have read countless times about the relativity of simultaneity, I do
not recall reading about the ordering of events on straight lines in
space-time. Please let me know if others have created the complete table shown
above.

The subject of all totally ordered sets in space-time came up while thinking
about causality in quantum mechanics. [Bell's Future Quantum Mechanics|https://bit.ly/BellsFuture]
is a page devoted to the new interpretation. See the bottom of the page for
other presentations of the idea.
