# Special relativity and special squares

## The **special** in special relativity

Einstein's theory of special relativity applied only to one particular class of
observers: those that were traveling at a constant velocity.  Any deviation
from constant motion - caused by going around a corner or sitting in a
gravitational field - and special relativity does not apply.  Einstein turned
to his friends skilled in the mathematical arts for a way to deal with other
kinds of observers.  The answer his friends said were the tools of differential
geometry developed developed by Riemann: metrics and tensors.
