Two stars go supernova while four kids watch.

There is a difference in time (dt).

There is a difference in space (dR).

Together they make a difference in space-time.

Each kid measures a different values for time and space.

Yet the walkers agree on something they can calculate called the interval.
This is the standard physics of Special Relativity, the physics of moving.

This site promotes a new proposal for gravity called Quaternion Gravity where
the kids above or below agree on a different value they calculate, 
space-times-time. In this standard approach to gravity known as General 
Relativity, this is almost, but not quite true.

## For nerds

Special relativity is special because it is restricted to inertial observers. 
To cover more cases requires the machinery of differential geometry. A tensor 
can be added to another tensor or multiplied by a scalar. An interval is 
formed by contracting two rank 1 contra-variant tensors with a symmetric, 
rank-2 metric tensor. A connection is needed to describe how the metric 
changes in space-time. There are many technical choices one makes along the 
way to calculating an interval in curved space-time.

The site issues a formal challenge to the algebraic standards of differential 
geometry used today by physics. In place of tensors, metrics, and connections, 
only quaternions will be used. For those trained in the craft of differential 
geometry, that should sound wildly inadequate. It is always a great challenge
to do more with less.
