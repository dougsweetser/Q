# Quaternion gravity

Looking down or looking from below changes time and space measurements in opposite ways.

If one kid is at a different height in a gravity field to another, then
time measurements get smaller while spatial ones get bigger.  That is standard 
physics (general relativity, GR).

The Quaternion Gravity (QG) proposal says the space-times-time values are 
precisely the same.  With general relativity, this space-times-time is not 
mentioned, but it is almost - but not quite - the same.

Note: the numbers are **far too big** (off by 16 orders of magnitude, I just
didn't want to write _lots_ of zeros).
