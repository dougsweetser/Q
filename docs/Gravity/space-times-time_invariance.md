Abstract

    The square of a quaternion luckily has the Lorentz invariant interval of
    special relativity as its first term. The other three space-times-time
    terms are commonly ignored. Ways to vary a quaternion with a continuous
    function that leave the intraval in the square invariant are discussed. 
    One method uses exponentials, leading to the hyperbolic functions found 
    useful in special relativity. Using the same approach to keep the 
    space-times-time invariantleads to a dynamic interval term. By preserving 
    the space-times-time terms using an exponential function and the geometric 
    source mass, an interval term is found that is similar but experimentally 
    distinct from the Schwarzschild metric applied to space-time 4-vectors. 
    Space-times-time invariance is not a field theory, so gravitons are not 
    necessary and quantization is moot.

General relativity, Einstein's elegant theory of gravity, is a field theory
like the three other fundamental forces of Nature: electromagnetism, the weak
force, and the strong force. The cause of gravity is any form of energy or
momentum. The field equations dictate the motion of particles with energy,
thus applying to all particles, even light.

Special relativity is not a special case of general relativity, despite the
name. Special relativity is about an invariant quantity in Nature that all
inertial observers agree upon: the interval, a difference of squares in
measurements of space and time. Special relativity applies to all
measurements, even those involving the fundamental forces. The product of a
measurement in space and one in time, referred to hereafter as space-times-
time, will change in known ways for different inertial observers.[^1]

This essay explores the opposite situation: what if two observers find their
space-times-time was an invariant, but their intervals were different? It is
suggestive that a defining characteristic of general relativity is that
intervals vary at different places in a gravitational field.

The invariant interval of special relativity in flat spacetime is generated by
contracting a 4-vector using the Minkowski metric. With such a simple system,
other products are omitted, namely, any with the space-times-time form, dtdxi.
Such terms could appear if one used a metric with non-diagonal components
which are unnecessary for flat spacetime.

There is a type of math that naturally embraces space-times-time terms. All
are familiar with real numbers, a mathematical field that allows for addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. The complex numbers are also a
mathematical field, but now one has two degrees of freedom, often represented
by a pair of numbers.[^2] Complex
numbers are no longer a totally ordered set. The next sort of numbers has
four-part harmonies, with a real bass and three imaginary tenors. Known as the
quaternions, they do not commute, so live with the label of a division
algebra. Quaternions still retain addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. The rules are similar for the complex numbers, with the imaginary i
replaced by an imaginary 3-vector and the inclusion of the anti-symmetric
cross product. Quaternions play a minor technical role as the best way to do
rotations in three dimensions.[8] A unit quaternion SU(2) sits in the center
of the standard model gauge symmetries. Despite that central role, quaternions
have historically been vilified to a comic degree.

    "Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and
    though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have
    touched them in any way, including Maxwell."  
    
    Lord Kelvin[10, See vol. II, p. 1070.]  
  
There are published claims that one cannot write the Maxwell equations or
represent the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions.[2, 4, 6, 9] Neither
happens to be true. See the appendix for details if interested.

The square of a space-time measurement represented with quaternions is:

![dt, dx sub 1, dx sub 2, dx sub 3 squared equals dt squared minus dx sub 1 squared minus dx sub 2 squared minus dx sub 3 squared, 2 dt dx sub 1, 2 dt dx sub 2, 2 dt dx sub 3](q_squared.svg)
  
The first term of the square is the Lorentz invariant interval. It is followed
by the three space-times-time terms. There are a few advantages to having
these three extra bits of information. Say two inertial observers Alice and
Bob saw a collection of events. The first term of the square of the quaternion
would be the same. An analysis of the space-times-time value would let us know
how Alice was moving relative to Bob. If they also calculate the product of
two different events in both orders, then we would know something about the
angle between the events and the observer. If ab = ba, then they are in a
straight line. If for the three space-times-time terms, ab = -ba , they are at
a right angle. Anything between those extremes is in between.

What happens in curved space-time? With the standard machinery of differential
geometry, a simple subtraction is not allowed. Instead, one has to parallel
transport one event to another along a geodesic using a known connection. Then
the subtraction can be done properly.

Quaternions don't have a metric. Without a metric, there is no connection.
Maybe quaternions are an "unmixed evil." Let's explore anyway.

Construct a quaternion out of space-time functions that can be varied, yet the
first term of the square is invariant as required by special relativity:

![dt, dg sub 1, dg sub 2, dg sub 3 squared equals dt squared minus dg sub 1 squared minus dg sub 2 squared minus dg sub 3 squared, 2 dt dg sub 1, 2 dt dg sub 2, 2 dt dg sub 3](fg_squared.svg)
  
If the function f was exactly the same as each normalized gi, then the first
term in the square, the interval, would always be zero.[^3] This is an important case: it is light. Changes in
time are exactly equal to the magnitude of changes in space.

With zero covered, find a way so the first term in the square is equal to one
for all inertial observers. The square of f must cancel out the square of g,
but leave unity behind. Work with a third function h and its inverse:

![f equals one half h + the inverse of h, g 1, 2, 3 equals one over 2 the
square root of 3 times h minus the inverse of h. The square of f g 1, 2, 3
equals one, then three timer of one over 2 the sqaure root of 3 times h squared minus the inverse of h squared](fg_squared_is_unity.svg)
  
So long as the function h has an inverse, this will always work.[^4] Exponential functions play an important
role in theoretical physics. If the exponent is zero, unity is the result and
nothing is changed. For tiny exponents, the result may contain a simple
harmonic oscillator which are ubiquitous in Nature. For the case in hand, the
function f is a hyperbolic cosine which is the stretch factor gamma of special
relativity. The function g is the hyperbolic sine, the gamma beta factor that
also appears in special relativity.

Repeat these two simple math exercises for space-times-time. Find a general
way to make the square of a measurement have either three zeroes or three ones
- times the factor of two that is from the sum of two identical terms.
Generating three zero space-times-time factors is easy: take the norm of any
quaternion. Some effort has gone into quantum mechanics that uses quaternions
in place of complex numbers.[1] That topic is beyond the scope of this short
essay. The general way to generate three factors of two is also not difficult:

![f equals the inverse of h. g 1, 2, 3 equals h. f, g 1, 2, 3 squared equals
the inverse of h squared minus 3 h squared, 2, 2, 2](fg_squared_is_222.svg)  
  
An exponential function could be plugged in as before. This moves from a pure
math exercise to one with physics content if the exponential is chosen to be
related to gravity by using the geometric length of a mass[^5]:

![e to the minus z dt, e to the z dR sub i over c squared equals e to the minus
2 z dt squared minus e to the 2 z dR sub i squared, 2 dt dR sub i over c equals
e to minus twice the geometric length of the source mass times dt squared minus e to twice the geometric length of the source mass times dR sub i squared over c squared, 2 dt dR sub i over c if z equals the geometric source mass or Newton's gravitational constant times big M over c squared and i goes from 1 to 3](exponential_conserves_stt.svg)

Let's pause to discuss this expression. No metric was used to get here. No
field equation was solved. Instead a new invariance of Nature has been
proposed as it applies to products of quaternions in a weak gravitational
system characterized by one length. Algebraically, the first term is the same
as the Rosen exponential metric applied to an event 4-vector.[7]

Experimental tests of weak gravity fields use the first three terms of the
Taylor series expansion in z for the change in time, and the first two for
changes in space. Those terms are identical for the space-times-time invariant
expression and the Schwarzschild metric in Cartesian coordinates. There is no
way to distinguish these two at what is called first-order Parameterized Post-
Newtonian (PPN) accuracy. At second order, the new invariance proposal
predicts 6% more bending of light around a gravitational source.[3] Since the
effect is smaller than a micro-arcsecond, that is beyond our reach today.

Massless light is bent by gravity. That can be accounted for in general
relativity because the coupling is to energy density which light has. With the
space-times-time invariance, there is no coupling term nor any field
equations. The same thing happens in special relativity: there is no coupling,
nor field equations. The space-times-time invariance may be the correct
variation on the invariant interval of special relativity, thus being the
simplest pure geometry approach to gravity, but not too simple.

With no graviton to quantize, there is no issue of quantizing a gravitational
field. What about energy loss by a binary pulsar? The Rosen metric allows for
a dipole mode of gravity wave emission, so is ruled out by the data which
requires a lower rate of gravity wave emissions.[11, See section 12.3(b).] In
the space-times-time invariant proposal, the exponential function and its
inverse applied to gravity above was static. Make it dynamic by including a
time factor in a way consistent with how we see the metric change in time for
a binary pulsar.

Is a graviton required to carry away the energy? The system in question is an
isolated binary pulsar that conserves both energy and momentum. It does not
have a dipole moment like a magnet, but does have a quadruple moment, like a
wobbling water balloon. The energy could be carried away by an electromagnetic
field that had a quadruple as its lowest moment. While unusual, it is
possible.

Does gravity as a space-times-time invariance play nicely with the three other
fundamental forces of physics? Given the stellar record of special relativity,
there is reason to hope.

### A  Appendix: Maxwell equations and the Lorentz group using real-valued
quaternions

The homogeneous Maxwell equations are vector identities. They hold when
written using quaternions. The Lagrange density used to derive the Maxwell
source equations is the difference of the squared magnetic and electric
fields[5]:  

![The Lagrange density of electromagnetism is one half B squared minus E
squared](L_is_B_squared_minus_E_squared.svg)

The difference of two squares is the product of their sums and difference. The
simplest product of a quaternion differential operator and potential generates
the difference of the magnetic and electric fields:

![The differential quaternion operation action on a quaternion potential phi, A
is the time derivative of phi minus the divergence of A, the time derivative of
A plus the gradient of phi plus the curl of A which equals a gauge field g, B minus E](DA_is_gEB.svg)
  
This also has a gauge field g which can easily be eliminated by subtracting
the conjugate of this product. The sum of these two fields - times a factor of
minus one - is formed by reversing the order of the differential with the
potential:   

![one eighth Del A minus the conjugate of Del A times A Del minus the conjugate
of A Del equations one half B squared minus E squared, 2 E cross B](get_to_B_squared_minus_E_squared.svg)

The first term drops into the Euler-Lagrange equations to generate the Gauss
and Ampere laws of electromagnetism. As a bonus, there is the Poynting vector,
the directional energy flux density of an electromagnetic field.

Representing the compact Lie group needed to do spatial rotations is itself
compact when using quaternions:

![R equals 0, x sub 1, x sub 2, x sub 3. U equals cosine theta, sine theta, 0,
0. R goes to R prime equals U times R times the conjugate of U which equals 0, x sub 1 cosine 2 theta minus x sub 3 sine 2 theta, x sub 3 cosine 2 theta
plus x sub 2 sine 2 theta](rotation_around_x.svg)

If one tries to simply change from the cosine and sine function to the
hyperbolic cosine and sine function, a member of the Lorentz group is not
generated. This should not be a surprise since that group is not compact, a
non-trivial change. Other terms are required to pull off the trick:

![B equals t, x sub 1, x sub 2, x sub 3. H equals the hyperbolic cosine of
alpha, the hyperbolic sine of alpha, 0, 0. B goes to B prime equals H B the
conjugate of H plus one half the difference of the congugate of H H B and the
conjugate of the conjugate of H the conjugate of H times B](boost_along_x.svg)

Quaternions provide another way to write these expressions. Nothing new is
learned, other than to be skeptical of claims about the limitations of
quaternions.
