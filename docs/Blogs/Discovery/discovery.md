Discovering a New Approach to Gravity

The process by which I came up with a new aproach to gravity will be sketched.
Due to the constraints of a full time job and family, and being middle aged, I
don't have good documentation about what exactly happened when, so this is more
impressionistic than something based on careful autobiographical notes.

In the Spring ot 2016, I was thinking again about the square of a difference
quaternion:

Filed away in my brain was a quote from Abraham Pais' most excellent scientific
biography of Albert Einstein, "Subtle is the Lord...", right in the
introduction:

    Were I asked for a one-sentence biography of Einstein, I would say, 'He was
    the freest man I have ever known.' Had I to compose a one-sentence scientific
    biography of him, I would write, "Better than anyone before or after him, he knew
    how to invent invariance principles and make use of statistical fluctuations.'
