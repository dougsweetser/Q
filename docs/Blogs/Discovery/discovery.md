Discovering a New Approach to Gravity

The process by which I came up with a new aproach to gravity will be sketched.
Due to the constraints of a full time job and family, and being middle aged, I
don't have good documentation about what exactly happened when, so this is more
impressionistic than something based on careful autobiographical notes.

In the Spring ot 2016, I was thinking again about the square of a difference
quaternion:

Filed away in my brain was a quote from Abraham Pais' most excellent scientific
biography of Albert Einstein, "Subtle is the Lord...", right in the
introduction:

    Were I asked for a one-sentence biography of Einstein, I would say, 'He was
    the freest man I have ever known.' Had I to compose a one-sentence scientific
    biography of him, I would write, "Better than anyone before or after him, he knew
    how to invent invariance principles and make use of statistical fluctuations.'

Looking at the square of the difference quaternion, the first term is the
invariant interval for inertial observers at the cor of special relativity.
That term is the reason I purchased quaternions.com in 1997. Oh, and some other
stuff. I always wanted the other three terms to have a name. I know I asked on
sci.physics.research what the three terms should be called, but that post to
the moderated newsgroup was not awswered. The Spring of 2016, I came up with a
reasonable name of (2 dt dx, 2 dt dy, 2 dt dz) - space-times-time. The name
describes exactly what it happens to be.

When two inertial observers agree on the interval between two events, their
space-times-time will be different. The precise difference of the
space-times-time values can be used to calculate how the two observers are
moving relative to each other.

What kind of physics results when two observers find the space-times-time
values are invariant, but the intervals are different?

I thought that was a good question.This is what I did in the the days after the
question was posed...

Nothing.

I have a crazy number of constraints in my life between work, family, diabetes,
and this research effort. With so little freedom, I have to make good choices
about what questions are good to think about. While walking the dog or shopping
for 2$ milk for my daughter, I questioned how good was the question itself?
