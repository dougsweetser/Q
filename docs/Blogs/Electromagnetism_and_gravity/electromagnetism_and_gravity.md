* Electromagnetism in a gravity field for the quaternion gravity proposal

Gravity is king, effecting everything. In this blog, the details of gravity's
effects on light will be detailed for both general relativity and the
space-times-time invariance as gravity proposal. This analysis leads to an
experiment to see which description of gravity is correct. Someday the data
will decide.

Light is bent by gravity in both theory and practice. Einstein considered the
path light would follow if viewed by an accelerating elevator. To such an 
observer, light appears to bend.

The equivalence principle of general relativity says that gravity is indistinguishable
from the accelerating elevator except for tidal effects.

Newton's scalar theory of gravity also predicts light will bend to gravity. As
a scalar field theory, it predicts one kind of bending, the g<sub>00</sub> term..
General relativity has that same term plus the effects of the curvature of space
of the same size, so the predicted change is twice as big for GR. In 1919, the
first results came in supporting the predictions of general relativity in an
experiment using photographic plates exposed during a total eclipse. It took 
the advent of radio telescopes to significantly increase our confidence in the
experimental results because a rare total eclipse is not required for such studies.
By measuring the change of radio sources as they approached the Sun, a more
complete picture of light bending at different distances from the Sun was done.
