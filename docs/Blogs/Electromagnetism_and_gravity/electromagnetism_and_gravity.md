* Electromagnetism in a gravity field for the quaternion gravity proposal

Gravity is king, effecting everything. In this blog, the details of gravity's
effects on light will be detailed for both general relativity and the
space-times-time invariance as gravity proposal. This analysis leads to an
experiment to see which description of gravity is correct. Someday the data
will decide.

Light is bent by gravity in both theory and practice. Einstein considered the
path light would follow if viewed by an accelerating elevator.
