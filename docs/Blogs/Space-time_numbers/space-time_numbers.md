* Quaternions versus Space-time Numbers

The history of the 4D division algebra know as quaternions will be lightly
sketched. Are these good enough to describe all the patterns of events in
space-time? I will argue that two specific issues dealing with the rules of
addition and multiplication require a variation on quaternions I call
"space-time numbers." It is simple enough to convert a space-time number into a
quaternion (but not the reverse).

** The Multiple Discoveries of Quaternions

A quaternion is a division algebra like the real and complex numbers, but with
four degrees of freedom. Gauss was the first to work out the algebra in one of
his notebooks. He did not publish the results, possibly thinking they were not
interesting enough. Today, most practical physicists do not consider
quaternions to be worthy of much study.

Rodrigues figured out how to use quaternions to do rotations in three
dimensional space. There are several technical reasons why rotations should
always be done with quaternions instead of Euler angles, but I will skip a
detailed discussion of that subject. Rotations in 3D space remain the
one-trick-pony use of quaternions by both rocket scientists and game designers.

Hamilton spent a decade trying to figure out a consistent set of rule to add,
subtract, multiply and divide triplets of numbers.
