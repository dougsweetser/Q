Bet Against Lubos

I spent years being an active reader and sometime participant in the moderated
newsgroup sci.physics.research. In the early days of the text-heavy  Internet,
there were newsgroups on all kinds of subjects that would allow people to
exchange emails about the topic at hand. When information had to go through a
dialup modem, text was the road to take.

The unmoderated newsgroup sci.physics was a soapbox for crank physicists. One
guy loved to write "TIME IS MASS". While amusing, it was not worthy of much
time or mass.

The most important feature of SPR as it was sometimes called was that Prof.
John Baez and a few of his friends posted tehre regularly. Baez loved to teach,
often at great length. There was a farmer from England who called himself "Oz"
that Baez spent a big effort trying to teach some quite obscure mathematical
physics concepts. The battlez between Oz and the Wizard were fun and
informative to read. I would toss in my own two cents once in a while. Much of 
what Baez wrote would not stick in my brain since it was dense with math
jargon. On the occassion when these obscure discussion did reach me, it made
the time investment worthwhile. Mathematical physics is a difficult art, so it
was nice when I felt I understood a subtle issue.

Every community has its characters.
