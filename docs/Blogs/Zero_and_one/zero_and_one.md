Zero and One Grouped Together

Nature is consistent is how she equitably deals with any and all events ever in
space-time. How does she enforce the same rules consistently on systems huge
and tiny? My research if focused on the idea that we need to get number theory
correct for space-time. The correct accounting system is needed for gransient
events in space-time to appreciate Nature's strange and subtle rules. The
target of this research is tensor calculus which is ubiquitous in theoretical 
physics.

Physics is the study of change. Sir Isaac Newton was the first great
mathematical physicist. He not only solved a tremendous range of problem sin
physics using both theory and experiment, but he also developed calculus, the
mathematical study of change. He conducted a flame war with the indepent
discover of calculus by Liebnitz. The formal study of calculus is know as
mathematical analysis. The starting point is a mathematical field. A
mathematical field forms a group under addition. The field without zero is also
a group under multiplication. The operations are associative. The distrubutive
rule also must work. An idenity element exists for both addition and
multiplication (one of the rules from group thoery).

What comes before a field? What does not change? Two numbers are needed to
think about events in space-time. Zero in space-time is here-now. The location
is centered on an observer where the clock is in the present moment. One in
space-time is there-then. It represents a signal an observer might see in the
future.

It is group theory that has brought order to the world of particle physics.
Group theory is there for mathematical fields. The first group to start with is
the trivial group. As the name suggests, there is only one member in the
trivial group. Yet there are an infinite number of ways to represent the
trivial group. This study is limited to zero and one. With zero, both the
operators of addition and multiplication form the trivial group.

Group property | Addition + | Multiplication *
---- | ----- | ------
Closure | 0 + 0 = 0 | 0 * 0 = 0
Associative | (0 + 0) + 0 = 0 + (0 + 0) | (0 * 0) * 0 = 0 * (0 * 0) 
Identity | I = 0: 0 + I = 0 | I = 0: 0 * I = 0
Communitive | 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 | 0 * 0 = 0 * 0
Distributive | 0 * (0 + 0) = 0 * 0 + 0 * 0

Zeroes are everywhere. One minor surpize might be the inverse for
multiplication. Care was taken to not mention the familiar subrtraction and
division operations. One reason to avoid these good old friends comes from the
needs of the associative property. There will be many situations where:

Only for the trivial group can it be said that the inverse of zero is zero.
Dividing by zero remains a bad thing to do.

For an observer, here-now remains here-now. Doesn't here now move forward in
space-time? An observer goes from one here-now to the next here-now without
paying any fee: 0+0=0.

The trivial group represented by zero and using both the addition and
multiplication operator does not represent a mathematical field. The technical
definition of a mathematical field stipulates that the addition identity _must
be different_ from the multiplication identity. The trivial group remains
trivial, unable to change. This may be a great thing: observers continue to
observe, never able to close their eyes to the evolving Universe.

Represent the trivial group with unity. This time the addition operator cannot
be used because the requirement of closure is lost: 1+1=2. The multiplication
operator with unity does form a group.

Group property | Addition + | Multiplication *
---- | ----- | ------
Closure | 1 + 1 = 1 | 1 * 1 = 1
Associative | (1 + 1) + 1 = 1 + (1 + 1) | (1 * 1) * 1 = 1 * (1 * 1) 
Identity | I = 1: 1 + I = 1 | I = 1: 1 * I = 1
Communitive | 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 | 1 * 1 = 1 * 1

The trivial group can be represented by unity and the multiplicaiton operator.
It is different from both representations using zero because it can be used to
make a continuous group. Take the set of all positive real numbers. Multipy
those by zero and zero is the result. Multiply them by unity, and that forms a
continuous group. For example, there is 4 and a fourth whose product is unity.

The mathematician Giuseppe Peano was able to construct the set of natural numbers
starting from zero and unity (see [the Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms)).
With the natural (aka counting) numbers in hand, one can then construct the
rational numbers using the multiplicative inverse.

Which of the three representations of the trivial group discussed here should one use to do
space-time physics? All three. The heart of physics beats from strong logical
tensions. Everything in the Universe, great or small, observers the rest of the
Universe, and can be observed by the rest of the Universe.

The number zero, here-now, fits the job requirements of a ceaseless observer.
The number one, there-then, can produce a signal to be observed later. Zero and
one as representing the trivial group is pre-calculus because the trivial group
does not allow for change. The fact that the unchangeable trivial group can be
represented by both zero and one will have interesting reprocussions for the
logic of physics.
