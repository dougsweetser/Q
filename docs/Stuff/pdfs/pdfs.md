## This site

The entire site is available a number of ways. As a book:

[Doing Physics with Quaternions PDF or EPUB](https://leanpub.com/doingphysicswithquaternionsv11)

I am not sure if leanpub is working so well, so [here is the pdf](../../Book/doing_physics.pdf) or [epub](../../Book/doing_physics_with_quaternions.epub).

Put the site on your own computer.  At the command line, run:

git clone https://github.com/dougsweetser/Q.git

A collection of 6 problem sets solved using only real-valued quaternions is
available for [$1.99 as a pdf, epub, or mobi file](https://leanpub.com/SRQ)

## Other people's efforts

1. [Gauss's notebook](Gauss_quaternion_pages.pdf) - Written in 1819, published
   1900, 6 pages. All calculations, no discussion.
1. [Sudbery's first paper, "Quaternion Analysis"](Quaternionic-analysis-memo.pdf), memo, 1977, 44 pages, on why quaternion analysis is no
good.
1. [Sudbery's second paper, same title](Quaternionic-analysis.pdf), 1979, 28 pages on the topic. Please look to my work
above on quaternion analysis for a much better alternative!.
1. [C. A. Deavours paper, "The Quaternion Calculus"](deavours.pdf). My critique is that using his
definition of a quaternion derivative, if a function like f=q is analytic in q,
f^2 is not. That indicates a better definition must be found before quaternion
analysis can really begin.
1. [Salamin's paper, "Application of quaternions to computation with rotations"](stanfordaiwp79-salamin.pdf), (1979, 9 pages) on rotations.
Howell and Lafon's paper, 1975, 13 pages, on the efficiency of quaternion
multiplication.
1. [Silberstein's paper, "Quaternionic Form of Relativity"](Silberstein-Relativity.pdf), 1912, 20 pages, on using biquaternions for quaternion
special relativity. Biquaternions are NOT a division algebra, and are not used
in any operations on this web site.

3D rotations, links provided by Alex Green:

Bottom line: always avoid Euler angles.
