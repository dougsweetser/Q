# Ye Old Shoppe

## T-shirts and prints

Really, there is nothing old fashioned.  Most of the merchandize is available
at [RedBubble.com](http://www.redbubble.com/people/visualphysics/shop).

The t-shirts with shipping run about $30.  That is not a great price.  The
reason is that these are created one at a time off of a high quality t-shirt
printer instead of doing a run of a few hundred using screen printing
technology.  RedBubble overs a variety of items with the images which have a
range of prices.  I am taking ~$4/shirt.  Note that I have spent on the order
of $60k over the years doing the research required to generate the content.
