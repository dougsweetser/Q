Promote the Doing Physics with Quaternions Project, and look cool :-)  
  
These 5 buttons represent a visual presentation of some of the key ideas
behind my efforts to unify gravity and electromagnetism.  
  
![Definition of Spacetime](../images/Stuff/Buttons/spacetime.jpg) 

Fine cuisine depends on starting with the best ingredients. Great physics
depends on using new powerful math.  An event in space-time has one dimension
for time and three dimensions for space, the most powerful tool would be a
generalized number that can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided, but
has four parts to it. There is one such number called a quaternion, shown here.
Time is t, and x, y, and z are the values the event may have in the three
directions, i, j, and k. Quaternions are the mathematical foundation for all my
efforts in theoretical physics.  

![The General Equivalence Principle](../images/Stuff/Buttons/equivalence.jpg)  

A person standing on a scale in a closed box could not tell the difference
between the box sitting on the surface of the Earth or the box accelerating at
the same rate as the Earth's gravity in a rocket ship as depicted here.
Einstein called this the equivalence principle, but it only applied to mass,
not charge. The General Equivalence Principle extends this idea of fooling
observers to cover any measurement. The box mathematically means "all the
changes in time and space." One can ask, what are all the possible changes in
the direction rulers (I) and the potential (A), or Box IA? The usual answer is
the rulers are fixed and it is the potential that changes, I Box A. However,
the answer could also be the potential is the same, but the rulers are
changing, A Box I.  

![Unified Field Theory](../images/Stuff/Buttons/unified.jpg) 

A unified field theory describes light and gravity in the same equation.
Einstein spent the last half of his life looking for one, but did not succeed.
The equation on the right reads in mathlish, "The change in the change in the
potential equals some constants times the source." The stars are involved in
games with plus and minus signs.  It takes work to see that the signs are
correct. A unified field theory must be able to describe all forms of change.
The graphic tries to depict this: changes in a square grid, changes moving
straight out from the center, changes that are circular ripples, and changes
that are spirals. The graphic does not show changes in time or the third
dimension. It is only a graphic after all.  

![Justify Your Love for the Standard Model](../images/Stuff/Buttons/justify.jpg) 

The standard model is used to quantify why there are this many of that kind of
subatomic particle, and that many of those particles. A vast amount of
exquisite detail is explained. No one has justified why the standard model
should be this way.  The standard model is constructed from what are called
symmetry groups which go by the names U(1), SU(2), and SU(3). The quaternion
unified field theory can be written in a way that lines up perfectly with two
of these symmetries.  The connection to the SU(3) symmetry is unclear now,
although technically it has the right number of fingers and toes (eight in this
case).  

![No Dark Matter Needed](../images/Stuff/Buttons/dark.jpg) 

Newton's law of gravity works to explain the rotation of the Moon around the
Earth. Newton's law of gravity works to explain the velocity of stars near the
center of a galaxy, but fails to explain why stars further from the center
maintain that same velocity. One hypothesis is called dark matter, stuff that
cannot be seen but makes the velocities work out just so. All physics laws must
respect relativity and the rules of calculus. These rules create the second
term which has a constant velocity and accurately describes the distribution of
mass with respect to the radius, no dark matter required.
