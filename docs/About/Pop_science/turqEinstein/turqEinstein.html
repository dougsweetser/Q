      <p> Einstein's most colorful idea was his theory of gravity, general relativity. 
        Space and time bend around a mass due to the necessity of geometry. Precise 
        experiments have demonstrated that general relativity rules the heavens.</p>
      <p> The problem is that general relativity will not dance to quantum mechanics' 
        quantized beat like every other modern theory. General relativity sways 
        to the continuous sounds of classical strings. Despite sixty years of 
        effort, attempts to make general relativity &quot;modern&quot; have failed.</p>
      <p> The artist is trying to unite general relativity and quantum mechanics 
        by using something old, something new, something borrowed, and something 
        blue. An old solution to general relativity is written in a new way by 
        borrowing a gamma from special relativity.</p>

      <h2 align=CENTER><tt>For Nerds</tt></h2>
      <p><tt> Newton's law of gravity works. General relativity works ever so 
        slightly better. Any replacement must match general relativity yet work 
        with quantum mechanics. The Schwarzschild conversion factor arises out 
        of a solution to four second order differential equations. This factor 
        expands or contracts measurements of time and space in a way analogous 
        to the gammas of special relativity, which are well integrated with quantum 
        mechanics. The artist has tried to make the analogy more precise, asserting 
        that a Taylor expansion of the Schwarzschild conversion factor is in fact 
        a gamma, amenable to all the tools of trade. E/c^2 has been illegally 
        substituted for mass so that the resulting gamma will not change its form 
        under a Lorentz transformation.</tt>
