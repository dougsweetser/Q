# Summary Statement 
Doug is a renaissance nerd, using knowledge from science and mathematics to
direct new projects in the arts and vice-versa. He received two S.B. degrees
from MIT, in biology and chemical engineering, and has a Masters in Software
Engineering at Brandeis. He has extensively exploited art and science
educational opportunities available in Boston to pursue his visions. As a
result, Doug is developing mathematics powerful enough to go head-to-head with
Einstein, backed up by software that can be seen on the web, has a first-rate
art collection, and he cruises through Boston in a bicycle of his own design.

## Internet Projects

### [Doing Physics with Quaternions](http://quaternions.com) 
Constructed all aspects of web site devoted to a new approach to physics.
Developed mathematics to manipulate 3D space and time consistent with known
laws of physics. Promoted interest in site, with over 3000 visits in a year from
every continent. 

### [YouTube Videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/sweetser)  
Have produced more than 150 videos with over 350,000 views. Provides the main
channel for the "Stand-Up Physicist" educational project. These 20+ minute
shows have aired on two local Massachusetts cable channels (Acton and Auburn).

### [Command Line Quaternions](http://quaternions.sf.net/)
An open source project to that makes animation out of quaternion expressions.
Remember analytic geometry, where writing y = x[sup]2[/sup] generated a
picture? The same expression can now generate a short film. The development of
this project has halted as a complete rewrite is needed.

### [Drummer Farms Condominiums](http://drummerfarms.com/)  
Designed web site for condominium association using an open source Content
Management System (CMS) called Drupal. Has slide shows and video walk through
of units. All condominium documents and newsletters are online. Owners can see
password protected minutes.

## Physics background

### Doing physics with quaternions
This research project entails trying to reformulate all the fundamental
equations of physics.  The reason for such a large task is to start from one
core hypothesis: events from any object in space-time are described by the
mathematics of a division algebra, known as the quaternions.  This
is an old goal, but Doug has made a number of new insights, including a new way
of expressing the Maxwell equations.

In 2015, developed a new approach to gravity. Minkowski space-time has its core
invariance principle, the light-cone. Energy-momentum together form an affine
space for space-time. Here the invariance has zeros along the energy and
momentum axes. All the invariants look like the light-cone rotated by 45 degrees.
It is my proposal that this **is** gravity, a symmetry where one uses escape
velocities for the hyperbolic curves.

Research has begun on using quaternion series (a semi-group with inverses) to
do all the work of quantum mechanics. There are world-lines outside of an
observer at the origin of space-time (0, 0, 0, 0). It it my proposal that the
machinery of quantum mechanics is designed to be able to make precise
statements about space-like world lines.

## Publication record

Physics in Rome, Italy, September 1999\. Presented a paper entitled "Maxwell's
vision: electromagnetism with Hamilton's quaternions", available at
