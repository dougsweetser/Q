            "text": "Scalars, Vectors, Tensors and All That\n\n\nAccording to my math dictionary, a tensor is ...\n\n\nAn abstract object having a definitely specified system of components in every\ncoordinate system under consideration and such that, under transformation of\ncoordinates, the components of the object undergoes a transformation of a\ncertain nature.\n\n\n\nTo make this introduction less abstract, I will confine the discussion to the\nsimplest tensors under rotational transformations.  A rank-0 tensor is known\nas a scalar.  It does not change at all under a rotation.  It contains exactly\none number, never more or less.  There is a zero index for a scalar.  A rank-1\ntensor is a vector.  A vector does change under rotation.  Vectors have one\nindex which can run from 1 to the number of dimensions of the field, so there\nis no way to know a priori how many numbers (or operators, or ...) are in a\nvector.  n-rank tensors have n indices. The number of numbers needed is the\nnumber of dimensions in the vector space raised by the rank.  Symmetry can\noften simplify the number of numbers actually needed to describe a tensor.\n\n\nThere are a variety of important spin-offs of a standard vector.  Dual\nvectors, when multiplied by its corresponding vector, generate a real number,\nby systematically multiplying each component from the dual vector and the\nvector together and summing the total.  If the space a vector lives in is\nshrunk, a contravariant vector shrinks, but a covariant vector gets larger.  A\ntangent vector is, well, tangent to a vector function.\n\n\nPhysics equations involve tensors of the same rank.  There are scalar\nequations, polar vector equations, axial vector equations, and equations for\nhigher rank tensors.  Since the same rank tensors are on both sides, the\nidentity is preserved under a rotational transformation.  One could decide to\narbitrarily combine tensor equations of different rank, and they would still\nbe valid under the transformation.\n\n\nThere are ways to switch ranks.  If there are two vectors and one wants a\nresult that is a scalar, that requires the intervention of a metric to broker\nthe transaction.  This process in known as an inner tensor product or a\ncontraction.  The vectors in question must have the same number of dimensions.\nThe metric defines how to form a scalar as the indices are examined one-by-\none.  Metrics in math can be anything, but nature imposes constraints on which\nones are important in physics.  An aside: mathematicians require that the distance\nis non-negative, but physicists do not.  I will be using the physics notion of\na metric.  In looking at events in spacetime (a 4-dimensional vector), the\naxioms of special relativity require the Minkowski metric, which is a 4x4 real\nmatrix that has (1, -1, -1, -1) down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.  Some\npeople prefer the signs to be flipped, but to be consistent with everything\nelse on this site, I choose this convention.  Another popular choice is the\nEuclidean metric, which is the same as an identity matrix.  The result of\ngeneral relativity for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass is the\nSchwarzschild metric, which has \"non-one\" terms down the diagonal, zeros\nelsewhere, and becomes the Minkowski metric in the limit of the mass going to\nzero or the radius going to infinity.\n\n\nAn outer tensor product is a way to increase the rank of tensors.  The tensor\nproduct of two vectors will be a 2-rank tensor.  A vector can be viewed as the\ntensor product of a set of basis vectors.\n\n\nWhat Are Quaternions?\n\n\nQuaternions could be viewed as the outer tensor product of a scalar and a\n3-vector.  Under rotation for an event in spacetime represented by a\nquaternion, time is unchanged, but the 3-vector for space would be rotated.\nThe treatment of scalars is the same as above, but the notion of vectors is\nfar more restrictive, as restrictive as the notion of scalars. Quaternions can\nonly handle 3-vectors.  To those familiar to playing with higher dimensions,\nthis may appear too restrictive to be of interest.  Yet physics on both the\nquantum and cosmological scales is confined to 3-spatial dimensions.  Note\nthat the infinite Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics a function of the\nprinciple quantum number n, not the spatial dimensions.  An infinite\ncollection of quaternions of the form (En, Pn) could represent a quantum\nstate.  The Hilbert space is formed using the Euclidean product (q* q').\n\n\nA dual quaternion is formed by taking the conjugate, because q* q = (t^2 +\nX.X, 0).  A tangent quaternion is created by having an operator act on a\nquaternion-valued function\n\n\n\n\nWhat would happen to these five terms if space were shrunk?  The 3-vector F\nwould get shrunk, as would the divisors in the Del operator, making functions\nacted on by Del get larger.  The scalar terms are completely unaffected by\nshrinking space, because df/dt has nothing to shrink, and the Del and F cancel\neach other.  The time derivative of the 3-vector is a contravariant vector,\nbecause F would get smaller.  The gradient of the scalar field is a covariant\nvector, because of the work of the Del operator in the divisor makes it\nlarger.

Neither of these will change under a\nrotation, and an even function times an odd function is odd.  If the order of\nquaternion triple product is changed, this scalar will change signs for at\neach step in the permutation.\n\n\nIt has been my experience that any tensor in physics can be expressed using\nquaternions.

It also says implicitly that i j = k, j k = i, and i, j, k must have\ninverses.  This is an important observation, because it means that inner and\nouter tensor products can occur in the same operation. When two quaternions\nare multiplied together, a new scalar (inner tensor product) and vector (outer\ntensor product) are formed.\n\n\nHow can the metric be generalized for arbitrary transformations?  The\ntraditional approach would involve playing with Hamilton's rules for the\nfield.  I think that would be a mistake, since that rule involves the\nfundamental definition of a quaternion.  Change the rule of what a quaternion\nis in one context and it will not be possible to compare it to a quaternion in\nanother context.  Instead, consider an arbitrary transformation T  which takes\nq into q'\n\n\n\n\nT is also a quaternion, in fact it is equal to q' q^-1.  This is guaranteed to\nwork locally, within neighborhoods of q and q'.  There is no promise that it\nwill work globally, that one T will work for any q.  Under certain\ncircumstances, T will work for any q.  The important thing to know is that a\ntransformation T necessarily exists because quaternions are a field. The two\nmost important theories in physics, general relativity and the standard model,\ninvolve local transformations (but the technical definition of local\ntransformation is different than the idea presented here because it involves\ngroups).\n\n\nThis quaternion definition of a transformation creates an interesting\nrelationship between the Minkowski and Euclidean metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to change from wrist watch time (the interval in spacetime) to the\nnorm of a Hilbert space does not require any change in the transformation\nquaternion, only a change in the multiplication step. Therefore a\ntransformation which generates the Schwarzschild interval of general\nrelativity should be easily portable to a Hilbert space, and that might be the\nstart of a quantum theory of gravity.\n\n\nSo What Is the Difference?\n\n\nI think it is subtle but significant.  It goes back to something I learned in\na graduate level class on the foundations of calculus.  To make calculus\nrigorous requires that it is defined over a mathematical field. Physicists do\nthis be saying that the scalars, vectors and tensors they work with are\ndefined over the field of real or complex numbers.\n\n\nWhat are the numbers used by nature?  There are events, which consist of the\nscalar time and the 3-vector of space.  There is mass, which is defined by the\nscalar energy and the 3-vector of momentum.  There is the electromagnetic\npotential, which has a scalar field phi and a 3-vector potential A.\n\n\nTo do calculus with only information contained in events requires that a\nscalar and a 3-vector form a field.  According to a theorem by Frobenius on\nfinite dimensional fields, the only fields that fit are isomorphic to the\nquaternions (isomorphic is a sophisticated notion of equality, whose\nsubtleties are appreciated only by people with a deep understanding of\nmathematics).  To do calculus with a mass or an electromagnetic potential has\nan identical requirement and an identical solution.  This is the logical\nfoundation for doing physics with quaternions.\n\n\nCan physics be done without quaternions?  Of course it can!  Events can be\ndefined over the field of real numbers, and then the Minkowski metric and the\nLorentz group can be deployed to get every result ever confirmed by\nexperiment.  Quantum mechanics can be defined using a Hilbert space defined\nover the field of complex numbers and return with every result measured to\ndate.\n\n\nDoing physics with quaternions is unnecessary, unless physics runs into a\ncompatibility issue.  Constraining general relativity and quantum mechanics to\nwork within the same topological algebraic field may be the way to unite these\ntwo separately successful areas.",

An abstract object having a definitely specified system of components in every\ncoordinate system under consideration and such that, under transformation of\ncoordinates, the components of the object undergoes a transformation of a\ncertain nature.  To make this introduction less abstract, I will confine the discussion to the\nsimplest tensors under rotational transformations.  A rank-0 tensor is known\nas a scalar.  It does not change at all under a rotation.  It contains exactly\none number, never more or less.  There is a zero index for a scalar.  A rank-1\ntensor is a vector.  A vector does change under rotation.  Vectors have one\nindex which can run from 1 to the number of dimensions of the field, so there\nis no way to know a priori how many numbers (or operators, or ...) are in a\nvector.  n-rank tensors have n indices. The number of numbers needed is the\nnumber of dimensions in the vector space raised by the rank.  Symmetry can\noften simplify the number of numbers actually needed to describe a tensor.  There are a variety of important spin-offs of a standard vector.  Dual\nvectors, when multiplied by its corresponding vector, generate a real number,\nby systematically multiplying each component from the dual vector and the\nvector together and summing the total.  If the space a vector lives in is\nshrunk, a contravariant vector shrinks, but a covariant vector gets larger.  A\ntangent vector is, well, tangent to a vector function.  Physics equations involve tensors of the same rank.  There are scalar\nequations, polar vector equations, axial vector equations, and equations for\nhigher rank tensors.  Since the same rank tensors are on both sides, the\nidentity is preserved under a rotational transformation.  One could decide to\narbitrarily combine tensor equations of different rank, and they would still\nbe valid under the transformation.  There are ways to switch ranks.  If there are two vectors and one wants a\nresult that is a scalar, that requires the intervention of a metric to broker\nthe transaction.  This process in known as an inner tensor product or a\ncontraction.  The vectors in question must have the same number of dimensions.\nThe metric defines how to form a scalar as the indices are examined one-by-\none.  Metrics in math can be anything, but nature imposes constraints on which\nones are important in physics.  An aside: mathematicians require that the distance\nis non-negative, but physicists do not.  I will be using the physics notion of\na metric.  In looking at events in spacetime (a 4-dimensional vector), the\naxioms of special relativity require the Minkowski metric, which is a 4x4 real\nmatrix that has (1, -1, -1, -1) down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.  Some\npeople prefer the signs to be flipped, but to be consistent with everything\nelse on this site, I choose this convention.  Another popular choice is the\nEuclidean metric, which is the same as an identity matrix.  The result of\ngeneral relativity for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass is the\nSchwarzschild metric, which has \"non-one\" terms down the diagonal, zeros\nelsewhere, and becomes the Minkowski metric in the limit of the mass going to\nzero or the radius going to infinity.  An outer tensor product is a way to increase the rank of tensors.  The tensor\nproduct of two vectors will be a 2-rank tensor.  A vector can be viewed as the\ntensor product of a set of basis vectors.",

The words for real and imaginary numbers arose from a\ncatfight between mathematicians over complex numbers. The labels I will use\nalways have to be tied to space-time. Please consider this odd constraint a\nplayful way to think differently about numbers for physics\n\n\nThe method for constructing quaternions with the roots in space-time will\nstart with discrete groups. A discrete group can be made continuous. The theory\nof Lie groups provides the background for such a process. Physics is about\nstuff in motion. With both \"stuff\" and \"motion\" broadly defined, animations\nwill be provided.\n\n\nI will detail the rules for addition, multiplication, and animations for 0,\nthe real numbers, the complex numbers, and the quaternions. Going into this\nmuch detail requires my longest essay ever. To provide an overview, here is one\nimage with the information:\n\n\n\n\nIn this essay we will discuss each area to understand the logic of numbers\nNature may use to account for everything.\n\n\nZero, One, and the Positive Real Numbers\n\n\nStart with the trivial group. It has one member, call it the identity element\ne, so the entire set is {e}. Mathematicians have provided a horrible label for\nthis group since it sounds unworthy of careful consideration. I was going to\ndo the same until I thought about how I was going to make a short film of this\ndiscrete group. It is the shortest of all possible films, lasting exactly one\nframe. I talked with the cinematographer, the lighting director, and the\nartistic director about the shoot: they all thought it would be easy. The key\ngrip interrupted my mumbling to myself to ask what we were going to take a\npicture of? The math consultant on the set said anything and everything can be\nconsidered a way to represent the trivial group. The permutation operator,\ncall it \np\n, means \nepe=e\n. The permutation operator works on any number or object\nto be found in the Universe. Making a one frame film about everything did not\nsound practical.\n\n\nI remembered \nPeano's work\n where  he built number theory up from 0 and 1.\n\nI will focus on two operators, addition and multiplication, because together \nthose are needed to make a mathematical field. A mathematical field in turn is \nthe ground floor needed for calculus, the study of change in space-time.  With \nrepresentation theory, one makes an abstract group concrete. For the two sets \nof number {0} and {1} and the two operators addition and multiplication, one \ncan represent the trivial group with ({0}, +), ({0}, x), and ({1}, x) but not \n({1}, +). Here is a way to view the topology, how numbers are connected.\n\n\n\n\nDownright trivial, as expected. There is only one thing, the black cube on a\nblack background. This image will get more complicated as new numbers are\nexamined.\n\n\nThe multiplication operator allows us to use either of the binary buddies to\nrepresent the trivial group. Here are the 4 needed qualities for \ne\n=1:\n\n\n\n\nThere is closure: 1 x 1 = 1\n\n\nThere is an identity: 1\n\n\nThere is an inverse element in the group: 1\n\n\nThe operations are associative: (1 x 1) x 1 = 1 x (1 x 1)\n\n\n\n\nThe same can be done for \ne\n=0:\n\n\n\n\nThere is closure: 0 x 0 = 0\n\n\nThere is an identity: 0\n\n\nThere is an inverse element in the group: 0\n\n\nThe operations are associative: (0 x 0) x 0 = 0 x (0 x 0)\n\n\n\n\nNotice I was careful not to talk about division. The operator is\nmultiplication and the set needs an inverse of multiplication. The set has one\nelement, and that element happens to be its own inverse with the\nmultiplication operator.\n\n\nThere is a good reason to never mention subtraction or division as operators.\nNeither of them is associative:\n\n\n(\na\n - \nb\n) - \nc\n != \na\n - (\nb\n -\nc\n)\n\n\n(\na\n / \nb\n) / \nc\n != \na\n / (\nb\n / \nc\n)\n\n\nThese two operators are so ingrained in me, it is hard to part with them, but\nI will do it for the sake of associativity and group theory :-)\n\n\nBelow is the product table, describing all possible multiplication products:\n\n\n\n\nTrivial again because \ne\n x \ne\n = \ne\n.  The same information can be presented with\ngraph theory, where the cubes are vertices and the edges are the multipliers:\n\n\n\n\nThe vertex in the graph is the cube, the edge is the pipe cleaner. The rule\nfor multiplication is vertex times an edge goes to a vertex. In this simple\ncase, the edge makes a loop. I also included a white straw as a way to\nrepresent the continuous version of the \ne\n=1 trivial group.\n\n\nRecall one of the fundamental differences between zero and one under\nmultiplication:\n\n\nn x 1 = n\n\n\nn x 0 = 0\n\n\nThink of the message these two simple equations tell. In the first case any\nnumber gets to stay just like themselves. In the second case, the number must\nbecome like 0. This is a source of tension in these two ways to represent the\ntrivial group with the multiplication operator.\n\n\nTry to make the trivial group cover more ground by using the set of positive\nreal numbers that do not have zero, \nR\n+ \\{0}. A continuous group is formed by\nmultiplying the trivial group represented by \ne\n=1 times every element in the infinite set\n\nR\n+ \\{0}. Each element in this continuous group will have a multiplicative\ninverse. This part of the story is exclusively about multiplication.\n\n\nRepeat this process exactly as before except to use \ne\n=0 as the representative\nof the trivial group. Zero times the positive reals without zero always\ngenerates a zero. The group remains trivial, having only one member.\n\n\nI don't want to go overboard with the following claim, but it is the kind of\nthing that makes thinking about physics interesting while I walk around. One\nprofound mystery in physics is how processes can be discrete as well as\ncontinuous, the proverbial wave/particle duality. It would be cool if the root\nof this mystery was an appreciation of the trivial group.\n\n\nThe Trivial Film\n\n\nHere is the one frame trivial film represented by \ne\n=0:\n\n\n\n\nIn space-time, now (\ne\n=0) goes on and on forever. The idea that this one frame\nanimation would last a billion years struck me as odd initially. Yet \"now\" is\nsomething that is always in space-time without anyone's intervention. Now\nrequires no energy.\n\n\nI don't think I can honestly make an animation of the trivial group represented \nby \ne\n=1, or its continuous extension \nR\n+ \\{0}. The problem is with start of \nthe film. It necessarily is in the future. Because zero is explicitly excluded, \nthere is no now to start the film to then see what the future looks like based \non a math model.\n\n\nIs the trivial group a mathematical field? It is time for me to open\n\"Principles of Mathematical Analysis\" by Rudin and turn to page 5. One needs\nboth addition and multiplication to have group properties. Check. The\ndistributive law must also hold. Check. All three of these work in the case\nfor \ne\n=0. There is a stipulation (M4) that the multiplicative inverse is not\nequal to the additive inverse. Therefore the trivial group is not a\nmathematical field.\n\n\nI will define something called the trivial mathematical field. It has every\nrule set out in Rudin without the requirement that the additive inverse be\ndistinct from the multiplicative one. The trivial group represented by the set \n{0} and the addition and multiplication operators forms a trivial mathematical\nfield. The trivial group represented by the set {1} and multiplication is not\na trivial mathematical field.\n\n\nSome might complain that the trivial mathematical field is beyond dull. I\nargue that change can only be understood against a backdrop that has no\ncapacity to change. It is the canvas for change. \"Now\" is an unchanging\nquality of the Universe. I sometime call it the observer where the observer is\nas passive as can be imagined. By contrast, I think of one as a signal in\nspace-time.\n\n\nThe trivial group will be there in all subsequent discussions of the real\nnumbers, the complex numbers, and quaternions. The tension between\nzero/now/observer and one/signal will remain.\n\n\nThe Real Numbers\n\n\nStart by understanding the rules for multiplication that require the \nabelian\ncyclic group Z\n2\n, also known as the sign group. Here is the product table:\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, the way to use a product table is to pick one value from the\nfirst column then multiply it by something from the top row to get the result\nfrom where they meet in the table. So \ne\n x \ne\n = \ne\n which is the trivial group product\ndiscussed in the previous section and \ne\n x \ni\n2\n = \ni\n2\n. Because the off diagonal\nelements are symmetric, the group is abelian, meaning the order of\nmultiplication does not matter.\n\n\nThe labels one uses for the product table (the \ne\n and \ni\n2\n) don't matter unless\none wants to tell a longer, logically consistent story. Since I have to pass\nthrough complex numbers on the way to quaternions, the \ni\n2\n will be helpful. The\nfolks at groupprops.subwiki.org use x, but -1 is common. To be honest, I use\n-1 to check I did things right.\n\n\nGraph theory can be used to communicate the same information:\n\n\n\n\nThe vertices are the cubes, the edges are the pipe cleaners. The trivial group\nrepresented by \ne\n=0 in black is here. The trivial group represented by \ne\n=1 \nis here too. The gray cube with the white loop is not the trivial group since \nit involves both \ne\n and \ni\n2\n. The four products in the product table should \nbe easy to find in the graph.\n\n\nIf the information is exactly the same, why present both the product table and\ngraph? The reason is biological: language is processed in a different part of\nthe brain that the visuals (which happens against the back wall of the skull).\nMore processing power is built into visual analysis, so it would be good to\nhave a precise visual representation of these ideas.\n\n\nIt is common practice to not include the white loops. I am consistently\nagainst dropping \"obvious\" information. Explicit trumps implicit. The gray\npipe cleaner is bi-directional because the vertex \ne\n times \ni\n2\n gets to the \ni\n2\n\nvertex, while \ni\n2\n times \ni\n2\n returns to \ne\n.\n\n\nWhile the discrete groups may help us understand multiplication, to get closure\nwith addition we often need infinite sets. Start with a discrete example:\n\n\ne\n + \ni\n2\n = 0\n\n\nThe astute reader will notice how this expression needs both possible\nrepresentations for the trivial group: \ne\n=0 and \ne\n=1, the additive and\nmultiplicative identities respectively. It is the multiplicative identity that\ncan be used to cover all the real numbers as before: multiply \ne\n=1 and \ni\n2\n by\nthe set of positive reals without zero.\n\n\nA way to represent the real numbers addition is with the real number line:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is this figure really? It is not a graph which has a vertex, edge, and\nvertex. I look at it as a statement of topology: the positive numbers connect\nto the negative numbers at the additive inverse and nowhere else. Zero\nprovides the bridge between sets of non-zero numbers.\n\n\nThe real numbers with both the addition and multiplication operators form a\nmathematical field.\n\n\nAnimations of Time Numbers\n\n\nWhat do real numbers represent in patterns of events in space-time? Time. Like\nthe real numbers, time is a totally ordered set. One event in time can either\nbe:\n\n\n\n\nbefore another event\n\n\nafter another event\n\n\nat the same time as another event\n\n\n\n\nfor any particular observer. The \"particular observer\" caveat is important\nfrom what we know of special relativity. Two observers can and will disagree\nabout what should be said about the order in time of any particular set of\nevents, but each observer individually has a specific ordering.\n\n\nInstead of the label \"real numbers\", I will use the label \"time numbers\". All\nthe properties of real numbers are found in time numbers. I am forcing this\njargon change on myself to shift how I view numbers, from something full of\nthe history of mathematics to how Nature may use numbers in space-time.\n\n\nFor time numbers, zero is now. The location of now is arbitrary. The past is a\ndistance in time from a past event to now. The future is a distance in time\nfrom now to a future event. When one says that there is always an additive\ninverse, that means there always is a time in the past that is equally far\nfrom now as a time in the future is from now.\n\n\nI will do a discrete time animation first. This short film has three times: one\nfor \ni\n2\n, 0, and \ne\n. Those frames represent the past, now, and future time\nrespectively. My first discrete time number film titled \"100\" has an event in\nthe past and nothing else.\n\n\n\n\nI have put the short film on repeat. Here is the film titled \"101\":\n\n\n\n\nNotice the symmetry: the past looks exactly like the future. That is the case\nfor half of the eight possible discrete videos.\n\n\nWhat does zero look like? It depends on which element one uses. If it is \ne\n=0,\nthe observer, then now is a blank cube. If it is \ne\n=1, the signal, then we\nexpect a box in the now cube.\n\n\n\n\nI hope you find this as troubling as I did initially. The roots go back to the\ntwo representations of the trivial group that have quite different properties.\nIf \ne\n=0, that is the blank, always blank idea of now. This one is easy to\naccept. It is also easy to accept the signal in the past as a white cube or in\nthe future as a white cube. The idea of treating time as a number is that any\nmoment can be made to be now. When a future signal becomes now, it will still\nbe a signal at time now (aka zero).\n\n\nAnother way to view this is that every material object in the universe\nnecessarily requires both representations of the trivial group. If I am\nlooking at the object, it is a signal. If the object is being the observer, it\nis the center of its own world in time and space.\n\n\nThere are 2\n3\n=8 discrete time number films.\n\n\n\n\nI have a difficult time digesting 8 animations (8 stills is far more simple\nfor my brain). The upper left hand corner is all observer, all zeros. The\nlower right is all signals, all the time. Each horizontal pair is different in\nthe now frame. Each vertical pair is different in the past frame, but has the\nsame now and future.\n\n\nA continuous animation of time creates a conceptual problem: how to deal with\ninfinity. No critical reader will believe an animation started infinitely long\nago in the past, not that I have the resources to keep a film going beyond\nfour billion years when the Sun becomes a red giant and envelopes the Earth. I\nreally just need to understand Lie algebras better. That will have to await\nanother day. Let me just assert there should be a way to go from the discrete\ncyclic group Z\n2\n to a continuous, smooth group of numbers that are all greater\nthan a negative number \na\n and less than a positive number \nb\n. In other words, \nhave a limited section of the time number line including zero. Consider this \ngraph of points on the time number line:\n\n\n\n\nAn animation of the time number line is nothing more than a steady scan from\nleft to right:\n\n\n\n\nThere is no space to this animation. Something is either there or not. The\nmoment marked as now should feel completely arbitrary because it is. Now is\nalso brief in this context. You need to watch for it as it blinks by. An\nessential quality of time numbers is that any point can be designated as now,\nthe additive inverse of zero.\n\n\nBut wasn't now forever? Yes for the trivial group, not so with a past and\nfuture defined.\n\n\nThe Time Number Doublet\n\n\nI have said I want to only write down positive numbers because a minus\noperator is not associative. That creates a problem. How should I write down a\nnegative number? Perhaps I could insist that the minus sign never be used as\nan operator, instead always staying \"close\" to the number in question. Yet\nthere is a bigger issue: the group Z\n2\n looks, well, like it should involve two\nthings. The same applies to the addition rule which has two continuous sets\nthat meet at zero. The two sets have different labels, but otherwise are\nprecisely the same sets. Time numbers are constructed from two different\nrepresentations of the trivial group, \ne\n=0 and \ne\n=1. How can we use both?\n\n\nWith real numbers, notation is easy: numbers come in 1-tuples: (1), (-2),\n(0)... No one actually wastes the effort to write parentheses. I propose a new\nnomenclature for time numbers called the doublet. Let me show, then tell:\n\n\n\n\nThe rules for doublets are simple: one or two of the numbers inside the square\nbrackets must be zero. A doublet without a zero is not allowed. The first one\nis the positive number, the second one is the additive inverse.\n\n\nAn event described by \na\n time number can be in the future ([\na\n, 0]), in the past\n([0, \nb\n]), or now ([0, 0]), but never in the past and future. Events work that\nway. Real numbers have the same property: no number can be both positive and\nnegative.\n\n\nWriting out an additive inverse is simplicity itself:\n\n\n\n\nAll this says is adding the time \na\n in the future plus the time \na\n in the past\nbrings one to now.\n\n\nHidden But Not a Hidden Variable\n\n\nFor the discrete time number animations, I had titles like \"000\" and \"010\".\nThey were visually distinct. Perhaps triplets should be used instead of\ndoublets for time numbers. I suspect that is the wrong approach. How can we\nlearn about zero using addition and multiplication? Addition would provide no\ninformation since 0+\na\n=\na\n. Multiplication is no better, leaving us where we\nstarted - at now=0 no matter what number is used.\n\n\nOne could just wait until now was in the past. The problem with such an\napproach is the current now is suffering the same plight. I summarize the\nsituation like so:\n\n\n\"You cannot know yourself, you can only be yourself in the moment.\"\n\n\n\nAll observers, big and subatomic, are in this same boat due to the\nmathematical logic. Now is not subject to change. Now is.\n\n\nComplex Numbers\n\n\nStart as before by understanding the rules of multiplication. Those rules are\ncontained in the \nabelian cyclic group Z\n4\n. Here is the product table:\n\n\n\n\nI love how no minus signs are needed since that is one of the oldest rules I\nlearned about the products of complex numbers. Here again my expectations were\nwrong: I expected two things but have four. Fortunately the group theory nerds\nare on my side, saying the cyclic group Z\n4\n over the complex numbers except\nzero is the reason for the rules of complex number multiplication.\nThe trivial group represented by \ne\n=1 lives in the upper left hand corner. \nThe cyclic group Z\n2\n is also there as the intersection of the first and third \ncolumns.\n\n\nThe graph of the multiplication will show the same information as the product\ntable to a different part of the brain.\n\n\n\n\nThe edges with \ne\n and \ni\n2\n in white loops and the gray cross are bi-directional.\nThe edge in yellow with a white bead is \ni\n, but with a black bead is \ni\n3\n. These\nedges are directional. The vertex \ne\n times \ni\n gets to \ni\n, but to go back, one\nneeds to multiply \ni\n by \ni\n3\n to get to \ne\n because four \ni\n's make an \ne\n. The \ni\n's go\nclockwise while \ni\n3\n's go counterclockwise. This provides a simple data quality\ncheck. The graph for time number multiplication is the diagonal going from \ne\n\nto \ni\n2\n.\n\n\nTo make these discrete rules for multiplication cover more ground, construct a\ncontinuous group by multiplying each of the four elements in Z\n4\n by the\npositive reals without zero. This provides an understanding of multiplying\ncomplex numbers, but is silent about addition.\n\n\nAddition requires the time number rule plus a new one:\n\n\ne\n + \ni\n2\n = 0\n\n\ni\n + \ni\n3\n = 0\n\n\nThese two rules again use both ways to represent the trivial group. The key\nthing to notice is that both rules share the same additive identity. That\nrequires the real number line which contains \ne\n and \ni\n2\n, must intersect the\nimaginary one, with \ni\n and \ni\n3\n like so:\n\n\n\n\nThis is the complex plane. Addition works like one would expect. Multiplying\nby a time number expands or contracts how long something is around.\nMultiplying by an imaginary number creates a rotation of space-time.\n\n\nAnimations of Distance-time Numbers\n\n\nWhat is in a name? That which we call a complex number by any other name would\ndo math as sweet. To assert a connection with events in space-time, I will\ncall complex numbers distance-time numbers. The time (or real) part is a\nmeasure from the origin to an event either in the past or the future. The\ndistance is also relative to the origin. The distance is along \ni\n or its\nadditive inverse \ni\n3\n.\n\n\nStart with a discrete, three frame animation which has a past, now and future\nspread in space from \ni\n3\n to the origin out to \ni\n:\n\n\n\n\nIntroduce a new operator, the conjugate, that puts \ni\n values into \ni\n3\n and the\nreverse. Repeat the above animation, but include the conjugate values:\n\n\n\n\nThe conjugate operator is a spatial mirror. A pair of images are seen on\nopposite sides of the origin. This animation also happens to be symmetric in\ntime - the past looks like the future. Together, these two symmetries are used\nin the continuous U(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.\n\n\nThere are a total of 2\n3x3\n=512 different animations in this discrete universe\nwith three slots for time and three for space. One important upgrade from time\nto distance-time animations is now one can animate strings. In the time number\nanimations, all we saw was blinking. With distance-time animations, there can\nbe strings extended in space.\n\n\n\n\nWhere there is a string, one can start to make loops like so:\n\n\n\n\nOne thing I ponder is whether the 512 different discrete animations constitute a\ncomplete \"alphabet\" for the continuous complex plane. In other words, any and\nevery pattern in a complex plane could be represented using a combination of\nthe 512 discrete cases. Probably not, but they might be able to approximate\nevery possibility.\n\n\nFor the continuous movies (not shown, imagine longer animations), multiplying\nby a time of 2 makes the distance to now twice as big. The product of two\nevents at time=now which both have \ni\n values becomes an event in the past. The\nproduct of two time=now events, one with \ni\n, the other with \ni\n3\n, will be an\nevent in the future. If you find yourself fighting such an interpretation,\nrecall that all that is happening is a left-to-right line scan of the complex\nplane.\n\n\nDistance-time 2-tuples of Doublets\n\n\nAddition requires 4 straws, one for \ne\n, \ni\n, \ni\n2\n, and \ni\n3\n and the cube for \ne\n=0. The\ngroup Z\n4\n has the first four elements and Z\n1\n covers \ne\n=0. Two doublets should do\nthe work:\n\n\n\n\nThe first doublet is better known as the real numbers, the second as the\nimaginary numbers. When animated, the first doublet is for time, in this case,\nan event in the future. The second number is a distance, this one along \ni\n3\n.\n\n\nQuaternions\n\n\nThe pattern used in this essay should be established. Start by explaining the\nmultiplication rule using a discrete group. Show the graph for that group. Write\nout the rules for addition and its topology. Show an animated version of the\nnumber. The only thing that changes is that the story gets more complicated.\nThe logical consistency can be checked at any time by looking for the trivial\ngroup Z\n1\n with both representations, Z\n2\n, and Z\n4\n at any stage of the process.\n\n\nI have always described a quaternion as three complex numbers that share the\nsame real number. See what happens if one uses that idea with the group Z\n4\n to\nwrite out the product table for quaternion multiplication:\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the highlighted rows are identical. You should also be able to spot\nthree columns that have the same property. This suggests we could introduce a\nnew label that was a composition of these three rows:\n\n\nI\n2\n = (\ni\n2\n + \nj\n2\n + \nk\n2\n)/3\n\n\nInstead of a product table with 10x10 rows, the substitution would lead to one\nthat was 8x8 which looks like so:\n\n\n\n\nThe result is not a cyclic group due to the reduction of terms. This exercise\nhas derived the quaternion group Q\n8\n. That group provides the rules of\nquaternion multiplication so abstract no minus signs are needed. Note that\noften people use them, but it is not necessary. I still find this odd, but it\nis consistent with the story told so far.\n\n\nThe trivial group Z\n1\n and cyclic groups Z\n2\n and Z\n4\n live in the upper left hand\nquarter of the product table. Notice how elements in that quarter are\nsymmetric over the diagonal.  This is a sign that the three groups are\nabelian, meaning the order of multiplication does not matter. The same cannot\nbe said for the quaternion group Q\n8\n. The off diagonal elements are the same if\none of the terms is \ne\n or \nI\n2\n. Otherwise, the off-diagonal terms are the same\nelement - and \ni\n, \nj\n, or \nk\n - but will be to the first power on one side and a\ncube on the other. If you have played Sudoku, you will notice that each of the\neight elements appears only once per row and once per column.\n\n\nThe graph for multiplication using the quaternion group Q\n8\n is the most complex\nwe have seen so far:\n\n\n\n\nThe complex planes run along diagonals. One error checking technique I use is\nto make sure the white directional beads go in a circle opposite of the black\nones. You should be able to spot several complex planes, six in all.\n\n\nAddition must be just like before, only more complicated, four lines instead\nof two:\n\n\ne\n + \nI\n2\n = 0\n\n\ni\n + \ni\n3\n = 0\n\n\nj\n + \nj\n3\n = 0\n\n\nk\n + \nk\n3\n = 0\n\n\nAll share the same zero, the additive inverse.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I constructed this with a hot glue gun, it was simple enough to have six\nstraws line up and pass through the cube which has six faces. It was\nappropriate to put the spatial ones there. The white and gray straws stick out\nfrom corners, hanging on to three edges with a big wad of glue.\n\n\nIt might have been more accurate to do all the addition and multiplication\nsteps using animation. Such an effort will have to wait.\n\n\nOne thing should be striking: complex numbers look like they are great to deal\nwith flat planes, while quaternions are obviously designed for the animated 3D\nworld we live in:\n\n\n\n\nModern mathematical physics uses complex numbers and avoids quaternions.\nVisually, I can no longer defend the status quo.\n\n\nAnimations for Space-time Numbers\n\n\nI favor using the label \"space-time numbers\" over quaternions for a few\nreasons. Hamilton chose \"quaternions\" to emphasize the four-ness of his big\ninsight since he had spent a fruitless decade trying to multiply - and divide\n- triplets of numbers. The name suggests four equal partners. There is a\nseparation between one part and the other three. That is clear from the dash\nin space-time numbers.\n\n\nQuaternions were thought of as a series of multiplication rules over four real\nnumbers. In this essay, I have gone to great lengths to start from the trivial\ngroup. Space-time numbers are not a mathematical field because they do not\ncommute. That makes quaternions a division algebra, a post some consider less\nlofty. The thing to recall is that from any and all places in space-time, it\nis possible to get to any other place in space-time with the rules of addition\nand multiplication set out for space-time numbers. It is also possible to go\nback, because there is both an additive and multiplicative inverse.\n\n\nThe largest surprise was the size of the discrete possible animations. A cell\ncould be filled in or blank. There is the past, now, and future. Space has\n3\n3\n=27 possibilities. The number of discrete films one could make with this\nlimited palette is 2\n3x27\n=2\n81\n=\\~2.4x10\n24\n. This so swamps the 512 possible\ndiscrete distance-time number of animations. Nature has impressive diversity.\nSpace-time numbers - even the discrete collection - looks like it is large\nenough to encompass Nature's diversity.\n\n\nHere is a simple animation: linear motion.\n\n\n\n\nThe time-numbers always has a signal. The distance-time numbers moves to the\nright. The space-time numbers moves right and down. There are 26 different\nlines one could follow. An open question is how to map from the distance-time\nnumbers to the space-time numbers since the latter has two more degrees of\nfreedom.\n\n\nThe animation of a string for distance-time numbers can also be done for\nspace-time numbers:\n\n\n\n\nI added a twist in the future of space-time numbers in the third panel that is\nnot visible in the distance-time numbers in the middle. Extra degrees of\nfreedom can have visible consequences.\n\n\nHere are the loops:\n\n\n\n\nI did make a lot of arbitrary choices in the final panel. That is what having\na discrete space of 2.4x10\n24\n possibilities is like.\n\n\nThere are also new things that can happen. For example, consider a dynamic\nmembrane, an area that moves:\n\n\n\n\nI have no idea how to work with dynamic membranes.\n\n\nBackwards From Space-time Numbers\n\n\nThis essay has built up quaternions from the decidedly simple, isolated trivial\ngroup to the eight members of the quaternion group Q\n8\n that all connect to\nzero. The process was additive. Without being destructive, can we see the\nsimpler structures of distance-time and time numbers in space-time numbers?\nStart with this summary image:\n\n\n\n\nBecome red-green-yellow color blind. For addition, there are three straws\nabove the white/gray line, and three straws below. For distance-time numbers,\nthe three straws above act as one imaginary basis, the other three as the cube\nof that basis. The gray straw is the square of this new basis.\n\n\nGoing from the cube to the plane looks like a good math puzzle. For each\ncolor, one of the complex planes involves \ne\n and \ni\n2\n. This would have to be the\nfinal plane. Then one would have to come up with a few rules about how to go\nfrom red-green-yellow to just one color.\n\n\nTo get the animation to be like a distance-time, only count two of the three\ndimensions. For example, give credit for how top or bottom it is, but ignore\nhow much it is left/right and up/down.\n\n\nFor the time numbers, one approach is to take the results of the distance-time\nnumbers and roll up the paper, so the plane become a tube along the time\nnumber line. Alternatively, one could either take the square of any imaginary\nvalue which then tosses things onto the \ni\n2\n line. One might prefer to work with\nthe norm of imaginary numbers that puts numbers onto e. For the animation, the\nonly thing that counts is if there is a signal in the cube.\n\n\nSpace-time 4-tuple of Doublets\n\n\nQuaternions can be viewed as a 4-tuple of real numbers. That will not work for\nspace-time numbers that start one step below real numbers with two\nrepresentations of the trivial group. An 8-tuple would be so wrong. A 4-tuple\nof doublets may make sense:\n\n\n\n\nSome might object to writing at least 4 zeroes every time. In this case, 5\nzeroes were needed. I would argue this is how we normally describe events, but\nwe use silence for the zeroes. Say we observe something in the past, to the\nleft, high in the sky in front of us. We don't have to say the event was not\nin the future, it was not on the right, nor was it below and behind us. The\ndoublet notation makes these four implicit statements explicit.\n\n\nFor anyone who has made it to the end, thanks for reading. I hope I was\nprecise about what I think a space-time numbers is, a really complex\nquaternion that may have untapped power to explain patterns of events in\nspace-time.",

Mathematicians have provided a horrible label for\nthis group since it sounds unworthy of careful consideration. I was going to\ndo the same until I thought about how I was going to make a short film of this\ndiscrete group. It is the shortest of all possible films, lasting exactly one\nframe. I talked with the cinematographer, the lighting director, and the\nartistic director about the shoot: they all thought it would be easy. The key\ngrip interrupted my mumbling to myself to ask what we were going to take a\npicture of? The math consultant on the set said anything and everything can be\nconsidered a way to represent the trivial group. The permutation operator,\ncall it  p , means  epe=e . The permutation operator works on any number or object\nto be found in the Universe. Making a one frame film about everything did not\nsound practical.  I remembered  Peano's work  where  he built number theory up from 0 and 1. \nI will focus on two operators, addition and multiplication, because together \nthose are needed to make a mathematical field. A mathematical field in turn is \nthe ground floor needed for calculus, the study of change in space-time.  With \nrepresentation theory, one makes an abstract group concrete. For the two sets \nof number {0} and {1} and the two operators addition and multiplication, one \ncan represent the trivial group with ({0}, +), ({0}, x), and ({1}, x) but not \n({1}, +). Here is a way to view the topology, how numbers are connected.   Downright trivial, as expected. There is only one thing, the black cube on a\nblack background. This image will get more complicated as new numbers are\nexamined.  The multiplication operator allows us to use either of the binary buddies to\nrepresent the trivial group. Here are the 4 needed qualities for  e =1:   There is closure: 1 x 1 = 1  There is an identity: 1  There is an inverse element in the group: 1  The operations are associative: (1 x 1) x 1 = 1 x (1 x 1)   The same can be done for  e =0:   There is closure: 0 x 0 = 0  There is an identity: 0  There is an inverse element in the group: 0  The operations are associative: (0 x 0) x 0 = 0 x (0 x 0)   Notice I was careful not to talk about division. The operator is\nmultiplication and the set needs an inverse of multiplication. The set has one\nelement, and that element happens to be its own inverse with the\nmultiplication operator.  There is a good reason to never mention subtraction or division as operators.\nNeither of them is associative:  ( a  -  b ) -  c  !=  a  - ( b  - c )  ( a  /  b ) /  c  !=  a  / ( b  /  c )  These two operators are so ingrained in me, it is hard to part with them, but\nI will do it for the sake of associativity and group theory :-)  Below is the product table, describing all possible multiplication products:   Trivial again because  e  x  e  =  e .  The same information can be presented with\ngraph theory, where the cubes are vertices and the edges are the multipliers:   The vertex in the graph is the cube, the edge is the pipe cleaner. The rule\nfor multiplication is vertex times an edge goes to a vertex. In this simple\ncase, the edge makes a loop. I also included a white straw as a way to\nrepresent the continuous version of the  e =1 trivial group.  Recall one of the fundamental differences between zero and one under\nmultiplication:  n x 1 = n  n x 0 = 0  Think of the message these two simple equations tell. In the first case any\nnumber gets to stay just like themselves. In the second case, the number must\nbecome like 0. This is a source of tension in these two ways to represent the\ntrivial group with the multiplication operator.  Try to make the trivial group cover more ground by using the set of positive\nreal numbers that do not have zero,  R + \\{0}. A continuous group is formed by\nmultiplying the trivial group represented by  e =1 times every element in the infinite set R + \\{0}. Each element in this continuous group will have a multiplicative\ninverse. This part of the story is exclusively about multiplication.  Repeat this process exactly as before except to use  e =0 as the representative\nof the trivial group. Zero times the positive reals without zero always\ngenerates a zero. The group remains trivial, having only one member.  I don't want to go overboard with the following claim, but it is the kind of\nthing that makes thinking about physics interesting while I walk around. One\nprofound mystery in physics is how processes can be discrete as well as\ncontinuous, the proverbial wave/particle duality. It would be cool if the root\nof this mystery was an appreciation of the trivial group.",

The labels one uses for the product table (the  e  and  i 2 ) don't matter unless\none wants to tell a longer, logically consistent story. Since I have to pass\nthrough complex numbers on the way to quaternions, the  i 2  will be helpful. The\nfolks at groupprops.subwiki.org use x, but -1 is common. To be honest, I use\n-1 to check I did things right.  Graph theory can be used to communicate the same information:   The vertices are the cubes, the edges are the pipe cleaners. The trivial group\nrepresented by  e =0 in black is here. The trivial group represented by  e =1 \nis here too. The gray cube with the white loop is not the trivial group since \nit involves both  e  and  i 2 . The four products in the product table should \nbe easy to find in the graph.  If the information is exactly the same, why present both the product table and\ngraph? The reason is biological: language is processed in a different part of\nthe brain that the visuals (which happens against the back wall of the skull).\nMore processing power is built into visual analysis, so it would be good to\nhave a precise visual representation of these ideas.  It is common practice to not include the white loops. I am consistently\nagainst dropping \"obvious\" information. Explicit trumps implicit. The gray\npipe cleaner is bi-directional because the vertex  e  times  i 2  gets to the  i 2 \nvertex, while  i 2  times  i 2  returns to  e .  While the discrete groups may help us understand multiplication, to get closure\nwith addition we often need infinite sets. Start with a discrete example:  e  +  i 2  = 0  The astute reader will notice how this expression needs both possible\nrepresentations for the trivial group:  e =0 and  e =1, the additive and\nmultiplicative identities respectively. It is the multiplicative identity that\ncan be used to cover all the real numbers as before: multiply  e =1 and  i 2  by\nthe set of positive reals without zero.  A way to represent the real numbers addition is with the real number line:   What is this figure really? It is not a graph which has a vertex, edge, and\nvertex. I look at it as a statement of topology: the positive numbers connect\nto the negative numbers at the additive inverse and nowhere else. Zero\nprovides the bridge between sets of non-zero numbers.  The real numbers with both the addition and multiplication operators form a\nmathematical field.",

One event in time can either\nbe:   before another event  after another event  at the same time as another event   for any particular observer. The \"particular observer\" caveat is important\nfrom what we know of special relativity. Two observers can and will disagree\nabout what should be said about the order in time of any particular set of\nevents, but each observer individually has a specific ordering.  Instead of the label \"real numbers\", I will use the label \"time numbers\". All\nthe properties of real numbers are found in time numbers. I am forcing this\njargon change on myself to shift how I view numbers, from something full of\nthe history of mathematics to how Nature may use numbers in space-time.  For time numbers, zero is now. The location of now is arbitrary. The past is a\ndistance in time from a past event to now. The future is a distance in time\nfrom now to a future event. When one says that there is always an additive\ninverse, that means there always is a time in the past that is equally far\nfrom now as a time in the future is from now.  I will do a discrete time animation first. This short film has three times: one\nfor  i 2 , 0, and  e . Those frames represent the past, now, and future time\nrespectively. My first discrete time number film titled \"100\" has an event in\nthe past and nothing else.   I have put the short film on repeat. Here is the film titled \"101\":   Notice the symmetry: the past looks exactly like the future. That is the case\nfor half of the eight possible discrete videos.  What does zero look like? It depends on which element one uses. If it is  e =0,\nthe observer, then now is a blank cube. If it is  e =1, the signal, then we\nexpect a box in the now cube.   I hope you find this as troubling as I did initially. The roots go back to the\ntwo representations of the trivial group that have quite different properties.\nIf  e =0, that is the blank, always blank idea of now. This one is easy to\naccept. It is also easy to accept the signal in the past as a white cube or in\nthe future as a white cube. The idea of treating time as a number is that any\nmoment can be made to be now. When a future signal becomes now, it will still\nbe a signal at time now (aka zero).  Another way to view this is that every material object in the universe\nnecessarily requires both representations of the trivial group. If I am\nlooking at the object, it is a signal. If the object is being the observer, it\nis the center of its own world in time and space.  There are 2 3 =8 discrete time number films.   I have a difficult time digesting 8 animations (8 stills is far more simple\nfor my brain). The upper left hand corner is all observer, all zeros. The\nlower right is all signals, all the time. Each horizontal pair is different in\nthe now frame. Each vertical pair is different in the past frame, but has the\nsame now and future.  A continuous animation of time creates a conceptual problem: how to deal with\ninfinity. No critical reader will believe an animation started infinitely long\nago in the past, not that I have the resources to keep a film going beyond\nfour billion years when the Sun becomes a red giant and envelopes the Earth. I\nreally just need to understand Lie algebras better. That will have to await\nanother day. Let me just assert there should be a way to go from the discrete\ncyclic group Z 2  to a continuous, smooth group of numbers that are all greater\nthan a negative number  a  and less than a positive number  b . In other words, \nhave a limited section of the time number line including zero. Consider this \ngraph of points on the time number line:   An animation of the time number line is nothing more than a steady scan from\nleft to right:   There is no space to this animation. Something is either there or not. The\nmoment marked as now should feel completely arbitrary because it is. Now is\nalso brief in this context. You need to watch for it as it blinks by. An\nessential quality of time numbers is that any point can be designated as now,\nthe additive inverse of zero.  But wasn't now forever? Yes for the trivial group, not so with a past and\nfuture defined.",

Yet\nthere is a bigger issue: the group Z 2  looks, well, like it should involve two\nthings. The same applies to the addition rule which has two continuous sets\nthat meet at zero. The two sets have different labels, but otherwise are\nprecisely the same sets. Time numbers are constructed from two different\nrepresentations of the trivial group,  e =0 and  e =1. How can we use both?  With real numbers, notation is easy: numbers come in 1-tuples: (1), (-2),\n(0)... No one actually wastes the effort to write parentheses. I propose a new\nnomenclature for time numbers called the doublet. Let me show, then tell:   The rules for doublets are simple: one or two of the numbers inside the square\nbrackets must be zero. A doublet without a zero is not allowed. The first one\nis the positive number, the second one is the additive inverse.  An event described by  a  time number can be in the future ([ a , 0]), in the past\n([0,  b ]), or now ([0, 0]), but never in the past and future. Events work that\nway.

Here again my expectations were\nwrong: I expected two things but have four. Fortunately the group theory nerds\nare on my side, saying the cyclic group Z 4  over the complex numbers except\nzero is the reason for the rules of complex number multiplication.\nThe trivial group represented by  e =1 lives in the upper left hand corner. \nThe cyclic group Z 2  is also there as the intersection of the first and third \ncolumns.  The graph of the multiplication will show the same information as the product\ntable to a different part of the brain.   The edges with  e  and  i 2  in white loops and the gray cross are bi-directional.\nThe edge in yellow with a white bead is  i , but with a black bead is  i 3 . These\nedges are directional.

This provides a simple data quality\ncheck. The graph for time number multiplication is the diagonal going from  e \nto  i 2 .  To make these discrete rules for multiplication cover more ground, construct a\ncontinuous group by multiplying each of the four elements in Z 4  by the\npositive reals without zero.

To assert a connection with events in space-time, I will\ncall complex numbers distance-time numbers. The time (or real) part is a\nmeasure from the origin to an event either in the past or the future. The\ndistance is also relative to the origin. The distance is along  i  or its\nadditive inverse  i 3 .  Start with a discrete, three frame animation which has a past, now and future\nspread in space from  i 3  to the origin out to  i :   Introduce a new operator, the conjugate, that puts  i  values into  i 3  and the\nreverse. Repeat the above animation, but include the conjugate values:   The conjugate operator is a spatial mirror. A pair of images are seen on\nopposite sides of the origin. This animation also happens to be symmetric in\ntime - the past looks like the future. Together, these two symmetries are used\nin the continuous U(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.  There are a total of 2 3x3 =512 different animations in this discrete universe\nwith three slots for time and three for space. One important upgrade from time\nto distance-time animations is now one can animate strings. In the time number\nanimations, all we saw was blinking. With distance-time animations, there can\nbe strings extended in space.   Where there is a string, one can start to make loops like so:   One thing I ponder is whether the 512 different discrete animations constitute a\ncomplete \"alphabet\" for the continuous complex plane. In other words, any and\nevery pattern in a complex plane could be represented using a combination of\nthe 512 discrete cases. Probably not, but they might be able to approximate\nevery possibility.  For the continuous movies (not shown, imagine longer animations), multiplying\nby a time of 2 makes the distance to now twice as big. The product of two\nevents at time=now which both have  i  values becomes an event in the past. The\nproduct of two time=now events, one with  i , the other with  i 3 , will be an\nevent in the future.

The only thing that changes is that the story gets more complicated.\nThe logical consistency can be checked at any time by looking for the trivial\ngroup Z 1  with both representations, Z 2 , and Z 4  at any stage of the process.  I have always described a quaternion as three complex numbers that share the\nsame real number. See what happens if one uses that idea with the group Z 4  to\nwrite out the product table for quaternion multiplication:   Notice how the highlighted rows are identical. You should also be able to spot\nthree columns that have the same property. This suggests we could introduce a\nnew label that was a composition of these three rows:  I 2  = ( i 2  +  j 2  +  k 2 )/3  Instead of a product table with 10x10 rows, the substitution would lead to one\nthat was 8x8 which looks like so:   The result is not a cyclic group due to the reduction of terms. This exercise\nhas derived the quaternion group Q 8 . That group provides the rules of\nquaternion multiplication so abstract no minus signs are needed. Note that\noften people use them, but it is not necessary. I still find this odd, but it\nis consistent with the story told so far.  The trivial group Z 1  and cyclic groups Z 2  and Z 4  live in the upper left hand\nquarter of the product table. Notice how elements in that quarter are\nsymmetric over the diagonal.  This is a sign that the three groups are\nabelian, meaning the order of multiplication does not matter. The same cannot\nbe said for the quaternion group Q 8 . The off diagonal elements are the same if\none of the terms is  e  or  I 2 . Otherwise, the off-diagonal terms are the same\nelement - and  i ,  j , or  k  - but will be to the first power on one side and a\ncube on the other. If you have played Sudoku, you will notice that each of the\neight elements appears only once per row and once per column.  The graph for multiplication using the quaternion group Q 8  is the most complex\nwe have seen so far:   The complex planes run along diagonals. One error checking technique I use is\nto make sure the white directional beads go in a circle opposite of the black\nones. You should be able to spot several complex planes, six in all.  Addition must be just like before, only more complicated, four lines instead\nof two:  e  +  I 2  = 0  i  +  i 3  = 0  j  +  j 3  = 0  k  +  k 3  = 0  All share the same zero, the additive inverse.   When I constructed this with a hot glue gun, it was simple enough to have six\nstraws line up and pass through the cube which has six faces. It was\nappropriate to put the spatial ones there. The white and gray straws stick out\nfrom corners, hanging on to three edges with a big wad of glue.  It might have been more accurate to do all the addition and multiplication\nsteps using animation. Such an effort will have to wait.  One thing should be striking: complex numbers look like they are great to deal\nwith flat planes, while quaternions are obviously designed for the animated 3D\nworld we live in:   Modern mathematical physics uses complex numbers and avoids quaternions.\nVisually, I can no longer defend the status quo.",

The name suggests four equal partners. There is a\nseparation between one part and the other three. That is clear from the dash\nin space-time numbers.  Quaternions were thought of as a series of multiplication rules over four real\nnumbers. In this essay, I have gone to great lengths to start from the trivial\ngroup.

The thing to recall is that from any and all places in space-time, it\nis possible to get to any other place in space-time with the rules of addition\nand multiplication set out for space-time numbers.

The time-numbers always has a signal. The distance-time numbers moves to the\nright. The space-time numbers moves right and down. There are 26 different\nlines one could follow. An open question is how to map from the distance-time\nnumbers to the space-time numbers since the latter has two more degrees of\nfreedom.  The animation of a string for distance-time numbers can also be done for\nspace-time numbers:   I added a twist in the future of space-time numbers in the third panel that is\nnot visible in the distance-time numbers in the middle. Extra degrees of\nfreedom can have visible consequences.  Here are the loops:   I did make a lot of arbitrary choices in the final panel.

Physics guides my choices in\nmathematical definitions :-)\n\n\nAn Automorphic Basis for Quaternion Analysis\n\n\nA quaternion has 4 degrees of freedom.  To completely specify a quaternion\nfunction, it must also have four degrees of freedom.  Three other linearly-\nindependent variables involving q can be defined using conjugates combined\nwith rotations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conjugate as it is usually defined (q\n*\n) flips the sign of all but the\nscalar.  The q\n*1\n flips the signs of all but the e\n1\n term, and q\n*2\n all but the\ne\n2\n term.  The set q, q\n*\n, q\n*1\n, q\n*2\n form the basis for quaternion analysis.  The\nconjugate of a conjugate should give back the original quaternion.\n\n\n\n\nSomething subtle but perhaps directly related to spin happens looking at how\nthe conjugates effect products:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conjugate applied to a product brings the result directly back to the\nreverse order of the elements.  The first and second conjugates point things\nin exactly the opposite way.  The property of going \"half way around\" is\nreminiscent of spin.  A tighter link will need to be examined.\n\n\nFuture Timelike Derivative\n\n\nInstead of the standard approach to quaternion analysis which focuses on left\nversus right derivatives, I concentrate on the ratio of scalars to 3-vectors.\nThis is natural when thinking about the structure of Minkowski spacetime,\nwhere the ratio of the change in time to the change in 3-space defines five\nseparate regions: timelike past, timelike future, lightlike past, lightlike\nfuture, and spacelike.  There are no continuous Lorentz transformations to\nlink these regions.  Each region will require a separate definition of the\nderivative, and they will each have distinct properties.  I will start with\nthe simplest case, and look at a series of examples in detail.\n\n\nDefinition: The future timelike derivative:\n\n\nConsider a covariant quaternion function f with a domain of H and a range of\nH.  For a future timelike derivative to be defined, the 3-vector must approach\nzero faster than the positive scalar.  If this is not the case, then this\ndefinition cannot be used.  Implementing these requirements involves two limit\nprocesses applied sequentially to a differential quaternion D.  First the\nlimit of the three vector is taken as it goes to zero, (D - D\n*\n)/2 -> 0.\nSecond, the limit of the scalar is taken, (D + D\n*\n)/2 -> +0 (the plus zero\nindicates that it must be approached with a time greater than zero, in other\nwords, from the future).  The net effect of these two limit processes is that\nD->0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe definition is invariant under a passive transformation of the basis.\n\n\nThe 4 real variables a0, a1, a2, a3 can be represented by functions using the\nconjugates as a basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin with a simple example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe definition gives the expected result.\n\n\nA simple approach to a trickier example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the fancy double limit process has been irrelevant for these identity\nfunctions, because the differential element has been eliminated.  That changes\nwith the following example, a tricky approach to the same result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the 3-vector goes to zero faster than the scalar for the differential\nelement, after the first limit process, the remaining differential is a scalar\nso it commutes with any quaternion.  This is what is required to dance around\nthe e\n1\n and lead to the cancellation.\n\n\nThe initial hypothesis was that complex analysis should be a self-evident\nsubset of quaternion analysis.  So this quaternion derivative should match up\nwith the complex case, which is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the same result up to two subedits.  Quaternions have three\nimaginary axes, which creates the factor of three.  The conjugate of a complex\nnumber is really doing the work of the first quaternion conjugate q\n*1\n (which\nequals -z\n*\n), because z\n*\n flips the sign of the first 3-vector component, but no\nothers.\n\n\nThe derivative of a quaternion applies equally well to polynomials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the expected result for this polynomial.  It would be straightforward\nto show that all polynomials gave the expected results.\n\n\nMathematicians might be concerned by this result, because if the 3-vector D\ngoes to -D nothing will change about the quaternion derivative.  This is\nactually consistent with principles of special relativity.  For timelike\nseparated events, right and left depend on the inertial reference frame, so a\ntimelike derivative should not depend on the direction of the 3-vector.\n\n\nAnalytic Functions\n\n\nThere are 4 types of quaternion derivatives and 4 component functions.  The\nfollowing table describes the 16 derivatives for this set\n\n\n\n\nThis table will be used extensively to evaluate if a function is analytic\nusing the chain rule.  Let's see if the identity function w = q is analytic.\n\n\n\n\nUse the chain rule to calculate the derivative will respect to each term:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse combinations of these terms to calculate the four quaternion derivatives\nusing the chain rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has the derivatives expected if w=q is analytic in q.\n\n\nAnother test involves the Cauchy-Riemann equations.  The presence of the three\nbasis vectors changes things slightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis also solves a holonomic equation.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no off diagonal terms to compare.\n\n\nThis exercise can be repeated for the other identity functions.  One\nnoticeable change is that the role that the conjugate must play.  Consider the\nidentity function w = q\n*1\n.  To show that this is analytic in q\n*1\n requires that\none always works with basis vectors of the q\n*1\n variety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis also solves a first conjugate holonomic equation.\n\n\n\n\nPower functions can be analyzed in exactly the same way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time there are cross terms involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, one might think these are incorrect, since the signs of the\nderivatives are suppose to be opposite.  Actually they are, but it is hidden\nin an accounting trick :-)  For example, the derivative of u with respect to\na1 has a factor of e\n1\n2\n, which makes it negative.  The derivative of the first\ncomponent of V with respect to a0 is positive.  Keeping all the information\nabout signs in the e's makes things look non-standard, but they are not.  \n\n\nNote that these are three scalar equalities.  The other Cauchy-Riemann\nequations evaluate to a single 3-vector equation.  This represents four\nconstraints on the four degrees of freedom found in quaternions to find out if\na function happens to be analytic.\n\n\nThis also solves a holonomic equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince power series can be analytic, this should open the door to all forms of\nanalysis.  (I have done the case for the cube of q, and it too is analytic in\nq).\n\n\n4 Other Derivatives\n\n\nSo far, this work has only involved future timelike derivatives.  There are\nfive other regions of spacetime to cover.  The simplest next case is for past\ntimelike derivatives.  The only change is in the limit, where the scalar\napproaches zero from below.  This will make many derivatives look time\nsymmetric, which is the case for most laws of physics.\n\n\nA more complicated case involves spacelike derivatives.  In the spacelike\nregion, changes in time go to zero faster than the absolute value of the\n3-vector.  Therefore the order of the limit processes is reversed.  This time\nthe scalar approaches zero, then the 3-vector.  This creates a problem,\nbecause after the first limit process, the differential element is (0, D),\nwhich will not commute with most quaternions.  That will lead to the\ndifferential element not cancelling.  The way around this is to take its norm,\nwhich is a scalar.\n\n\nA spacelike differential element is defined by taking the ratio of a\ndifferential quaternion element D to its 3-vector, D - D\n*\n.  Let the norm of\nD approach zero.  To be defined, the three vector must approach zero faster\nthan its corresponding scalar.  To make the definition non-singular\neverywhere, multiply by the conjugate.  In the limit D D\n*\n/((D - D\n*\n)(D - D\n*\n))*\napproaches (1, 0), a scalar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make this concrete, consider a simple example, f = q^2.  Apply the\ndefinition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second and fifth terms are unitary rotations of the 3-vector B.  Since the\ndifferential element D could be pointed anywhere, this is an arbitrary\nrotation. Define:\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute, and continue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at how wonderfully strange this is!  The arbitrary rotation of the\n3-vector B means that this derivative is bound by an inequality.  If D is in\ndirection of B, then it will be an equality, but D could also be in the\nopposite direction, leading to a destruction of a contribution from the\n3-vector.  The spacelike derivative can therefore interfere with itself.  This\nis quite a natural thing to do in quantum mechanics.  The spacelike derivative\nis positive definite, and could be used to define a Banach space.\n\n\nDefining the lightlike derivative, where the change in time is equal to the\nchange in space, will require more study.  It may turn out that this\nderivative is singular everywhere, but it will require some skill to find a\ntechnically viable compromise between the spacelike and timelike derivative to\nsynthesis the lightlike derivative.",

First the\nlimit of the three vector is taken as it goes to zero, (D - D * )/2 -> 0.\nSecond, the limit of the scalar is taken, (D + D * )/2 -> +0 (the plus zero\nindicates that it must be approached with a time greater than zero, in other\nwords, from the future).  The net effect of these two limit processes is that\nD->0.    The definition is invariant under a passive transformation of the basis.  The 4 real variables a0, a1, a2, a3 can be represented by functions using the\nconjugates as a basis.      Begin with a simple example:     The definition gives the expected result.  A simple approach to a trickier example:     So far, the fancy double limit process has been irrelevant for these identity\nfunctions, because the differential element has been eliminated.  That changes\nwith the following example, a tricky approach to the same result.       Because the 3-vector goes to zero faster than the scalar for the differential\nelement, after the first limit process, the remaining differential is a scalar\nso it commutes with any quaternion.  This is what is required to dance around\nthe e 1  and lead to the cancellation.  The initial hypothesis was that complex analysis should be a self-evident\nsubset of quaternion analysis.  So this quaternion derivative should match up\nwith the complex case, which is:    These are the same result up to two subedits.  Quaternions have three\nimaginary axes, which creates the factor of three.  The conjugate of a complex\nnumber is really doing the work of the first quaternion conjugate q *1  (which\nequals -z * ), because z *  flips the sign of the first 3-vector component, but no\nothers.  The derivative of a quaternion applies equally well to polynomials.       This is the expected result for this polynomial.  It would be straightforward\nto show that all polynomials gave the expected results.  Mathematicians might be concerned by this result, because if the 3-vector D\ngoes to -D nothing will change about the quaternion derivative.  This is\nactually consistent with principles of special relativity.  For timelike\nseparated events, right and left depend on the inertial reference frame, so a\ntimelike derivative should not depend on the direction of the 3-vector.",

The\nfollowing table describes the 16 derivatives for this set   This table will be used extensively to evaluate if a function is analytic\nusing the chain rule.  Let's see if the identity function w = q is analytic.   Use the chain rule to calculate the derivative will respect to each term:      Use combinations of these terms to calculate the four quaternion derivatives\nusing the chain rule.      This has the derivatives expected if w=q is analytic in q.  Another test involves the Cauchy-Riemann equations.  The presence of the three\nbasis vectors changes things slightly.    This also solves a holonomic equation.   There are no off diagonal terms to compare.  This exercise can be repeated for the other identity functions.  One\nnoticeable change is that the role that the conjugate must play.  Consider the\nidentity function w = q *1 .  To show that this is analytic in q *1  requires that\none always works with basis vectors of the q *1  variety.    This also solves a first conjugate holonomic equation.   Power functions can be analyzed in exactly the same way:        This time there are cross terms involved.     At first glance, one might think these are incorrect, since the signs of the\nderivatives are suppose to be opposite.  Actually they are, but it is hidden\nin an accounting trick :-)  For example, the derivative of u with respect to\na1 has a factor of e 1 2 , which makes it negative.  The derivative of the first\ncomponent of V with respect to a0 is positive.  Keeping all the information\nabout signs in the e's makes things look non-standard, but they are not.    Note that these are three scalar equalities.  The other Cauchy-Riemann\nequations evaluate to a single 3-vector equation.  This represents four\nconstraints on the four degrees of freedom found in quaternions to find out if\na function happens to be analytic.  This also solves a holonomic equation.    Since power series can be analytic, this should open the door to all forms of\nanalysis.  (I have done the case for the cube of q, and it too is analytic in\nq).",

The only change is in the limit, where the scalar\napproaches zero from below.  This will make many derivatives look time\nsymmetric, which is the case for most laws of physics.  A more complicated case involves spacelike derivatives.  In the spacelike\nregion, changes in time go to zero faster than the absolute value of the\n3-vector.  Therefore the order of the limit processes is reversed.  This time\nthe scalar approaches zero, then the 3-vector.  This creates a problem,\nbecause after the first limit process, the differential element is (0, D),\nwhich will not commute with most quaternions.  That will lead to the\ndifferential element not cancelling.  The way around this is to take its norm,\nwhich is a scalar.  A spacelike differential element is defined by taking the ratio of a\ndifferential quaternion element D to its 3-vector, D - D * .  Let the norm of\nD approach zero.  To be defined, the three vector must approach zero faster\nthan its corresponding scalar.  To make the definition non-singular\neverywhere, multiply by the conjugate.  In the limit D D * /((D - D * )(D - D * ))*\napproaches (1, 0), a scalar.    To make this concrete, consider a simple example, f = q^2.  Apply the\ndefinition:     The second and fifth terms are unitary rotations of the 3-vector B.  Since the\ndifferential element D could be pointed anywhere, this is an arbitrary\nrotation. Define:   Substitute, and continue:     Look at how wonderfully strange this is!  The arbitrary rotation of the\n3-vector B means that this derivative is bound by an inequality.  If D is in\ndirection of B, then it will be an equality, but D could also be in the\nopposite direction, leading to a destruction of a contribution from the\n3-vector.  The spacelike derivative can therefore interfere with itself.  This\nis quite a natural thing to do in quantum mechanics.  The spacelike derivative\nis positive definite, and could be used to define a Banach space.  Defining the lightlike derivative, where the change in time is equal to the\nchange in space, will require more study.  It may turn out that this\nderivative is singular everywhere, but it will require some skill to find a\ntechnically viable compromise between the spacelike and timelike derivative to\nsynthesis the lightlike derivative.",

Sweetser\n\n\nMarch 31, 2015\n\n\n*Essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2015 Awards for Essays on Gravitation\n\n39 Drummer Road, Acton, MA 01720\n\nsweetser@alum.mit.edu\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe square of a quaternion luckily has the Lorentz invariant interval of\nspecial relativity as its first term. The other three space-times-time\nterms are commonly ignored. Ways to vary a quaternion with a continuous\nfunction that leave the intraval in the square invariant are discussed. \nOne method uses exponentials, leading to the hyperbolic functions found \nuseful in special relativity. Using the same approach to keep the \nspace-times-time invariantleads to a dynamic interval term. By preserving \nthe space-times-time terms using an exponential function and the geometric \nsource mass, an interval term is found that is similar but experimentally \ndistinct from the Schwarzschild metric applied to space-time 4-vectors. \nSpace-times-time invariance is not a field theory, so gravitons are not \nnecessary and quantization is moot.\n\n\n\nGeneral relativity, Einstein's elegant theory of gravity, is a field theory\nlike the three other fundamental forces of Nature: electromagnetism, the weak\nforce, and the strong force. The cause of gravity is any form of energy or\nmomentum. The field equations dictate the motion of particles with energy,\nthus applying to all particles, even light.\n\n\nSpecial relativity is not a special case of general relativity, despite the\nname. Special relativity is about an invariant quantity in Nature that all\ninertial observers agree upon: the interval, a difference of squares in\nmeasurements of space and time. Special relativity applies to all\nmeasurements, even those involving the fundamental forces. The product of a\nmeasurement in space and one in time, referred to hereafter as space-times-\ntime, will change in known ways for different inertial observers.\n1\n\n\nThis essay explores the opposite situation: what if two observers find their\nspace-times-time was an invariant, but their intervals were different? It is\nsuggestive that a defining characteristic of general relativity is that\nintervals vary at different places in a gravitational field.\n\n\nThe invariant interval of special relativity in flat spacetime is generated by\ncontracting a 4-vector using the Minkowski metric. With such a simple system,\nother products are omitted, namely, any with the space-times-time form, dtdxi.\nSuch terms could appear if one used a metric with non-diagonal components\nwhich are unnecessary for flat spacetime.\n\n\nThere is a type of math that naturally embraces space-times-time terms. All\nare familiar with real numbers, a mathematical field that allows for addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division. The complex numbers are also a\nmathematical field, but now one has two degrees of freedom, often represented\nby a pair of numbers.\n2\n Complex\nnumbers are no longer a totally ordered set. The next sort of numbers has\nfour-part harmonies, with a real bass and three imaginary tenors. Known as the\nquaternions, they do not commute, so live with the label of a division\nalgebra. Quaternions still retain addition, subtraction, multiplication, and\ndivision. The rules are similar for the complex numbers, with the imaginary i\nreplaced by an imaginary 3-vector and the inclusion of the anti-symmetric\ncross product. Quaternions play a minor technical role as the best way to do\nrotations in three dimensions.[8] A unit quaternion SU(2) sits in the center\nof the standard model gauge symmetries. Despite that central role, quaternions\nhave historically been vilified to a comic degree.\n\n\n\"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and\nthough beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have\ntouched them in any way, including Maxwell.\"\n\nLord Kelvin[10, See vol. II, p. 1070.]\n\n\n\nThere are published claims that one cannot write the Maxwell equations or\nrepresent the Lorentz group using real-valued quaternions.[2, 4, 6, 9] Neither\nhappens to be true. See the appendix for details if interested.\n\n\nThe square of a space-time measurement represented with quaternions is:\n\n\n\n\nThe first term of the square is the Lorentz invariant interval. It is followed\nby the three space-times-time terms. There are a few advantages to having\nthese three extra bits of information. Say two inertial observers Alice and\nBob saw a collection of events. The first term of the square of the quaternion\nwould be the same. An analysis of the space-times-time value would let us know\nhow Alice was moving relative to Bob. If they also calculate the product of\ntwo different events in both orders, then we would know something about the\nangle between the events and the observer. If ab = ba, then they are in a\nstraight line. If for the three space-times-time terms, ab = -ba , they are at\na right angle. Anything between those extremes is in between.\n\n\nWhat happens in curved space-time? With the standard machinery of differential\ngeometry, a simple subtraction is not allowed. Instead, one has to parallel\ntransport one event to another along a geodesic using a known connection. Then\nthe subtraction can be done properly.\n\n\nQuaternions don't have a metric. Without a metric, there is no connection.\nMaybe quaternions are an \"unmixed evil.\" Let's explore anyway.\n\n\nConstruct a quaternion out of space-time functions that can be varied, yet the\nfirst term of the square is invariant as required by special relativity:\n\n\n\n\nIf the function f was exactly the same as each normalized gi, then the first\nterm in the square, the interval, would always be zero.\n3\n This is an important case: it is light. Changes in\ntime are exactly equal to the magnitude of changes in space.\n\n\nWith zero covered, find a way so the first term in the square is equal to one\nfor all inertial observers. The square of f must cancel out the square of g,\nbut leave unity behind. Work with a third function h and its inverse:\n\n\n\n\nSo long as the function h has an inverse, this will always work.\n4\n Exponential functions play an important\nrole in theoretical physics. If the exponent is zero, unity is the result and\nnothing is changed. For tiny exponents, the result may contain a simple\nharmonic oscillator which are ubiquitous in Nature. For the case in hand, the\nfunction f is a hyperbolic cosine which is the stretch factor gamma of special\nrelativity. The function g is the hyperbolic sine, the gamma beta factor that\nalso appears in special relativity.\n\n\nRepeat these two simple math exercises for space-times-time. Find a general\nway to make the square of a measurement have either three zeroes or three ones\n- times the factor of two that is from the sum of two identical terms.\nGenerating three zero space-times-time factors is easy: take the norm of any\nquaternion. Some effort has gone into quantum mechanics that uses quaternions\nin place of complex numbers.[1] That topic is beyond the scope of this short\nessay. The general way to generate three factors of two is also not difficult:\n\n\n  \n\n\nAn exponential function could be plugged in as before. This moves from a pure\nmath exercise to one with physics content if the exponential is chosen to be\nrelated to gravity by using the geometric length of a mass\n5\n:\n\n\n\n\nLet's pause to discuss this expression. No metric was used to get here. No\nfield equation was solved. Instead a new invariance of Nature has been\nproposed as it applies to products of quaternions in a weak gravitational\nsystem characterized by one length. Algebraically, the first term is the same\nas the Rosen exponential metric applied to an event 4-vector.[7]\n\n\nExperimental tests of weak gravity fields use the first three terms of the\nTaylor series expansion in z for the change in time, and the first two for\nchanges in space. Those terms are identical for the space-times-time invariant\nexpression and the Schwarzschild metric in Cartesian coordinates. There is no\nway to distinguish these two at what is called first-order Parameterized Post-\nNewtonian (PPN) accuracy. At second order, the new invariance proposal\npredicts 6% more bending of light around a gravitational source.[3] Since the\neffect is smaller than a micro-arcsecond, that is beyond our reach today.\n\n\nMassless light is bent by gravity. That can be accounted for in general\nrelativity because the coupling is to energy density which light has. With the\nspace-times-time invariance, there is no coupling term nor any field\nequations. The same thing happens in special relativity: there is no coupling,\nnor field equations. The space-times-time invariance may be the correct\nvariation on the invariant interval of special relativity, thus being the\nsimplest pure geometry approach to gravity, but not too simple.\n\n\nWith no graviton to quantize, there is no issue of quantizing a gravitational\nfield. What about energy loss by a binary pulsar? The Rosen metric allows for\na dipole mode of gravity wave emission, so is ruled out by the data which\nrequires a lower rate of gravity wave emissions.[11, See section 12.3(b).] In\nthe space-times-time invariant proposal, the exponential function and its\ninverse applied to gravity above was static. Make it dynamic by including a\ntime factor in a way consistent with how we see the metric change in time for\na binary pulsar.\n\n\nIs a graviton required to carry away the energy? The system in question is an\nisolated binary pulsar that conserves both energy and momentum. It does not\nhave a dipole moment like a magnet, but does have a quadruple moment, like a\nwobbling water balloon. The energy could be carried away by an electromagnetic\nfield that had a quadruple as its lowest moment. While unusual, it is\npossible.\n\n\nDoes gravity as a space-times-time invariance play nicely with the three other\nfundamental forces of physics? Given the stellar record of special relativity,\nthere is reason to hope.\n\n\nAppendix: Maxwell equations and the Lorentz group using real-valued\n\n\nquaternions\n\n\nThe homogeneous Maxwell equations are vector identities. They hold when\nwritten using quaternions. The Lagrange density used to derive the Maxwell\nsource equations is the difference of the squared magnetic and electric\nfields[5]:  \n\n\n\n\nThe difference of two squares is the product of their sums and difference. The\nsimplest product of a quaternion differential operator and potential generates\nthe difference of the magnetic and electric fields:\n\n\n\n\nThis also has a gauge field g which can easily be eliminated by subtracting\nthe conjugate of this product. The sum of these two fields - times a factor of\nminus one - is formed by reversing the order of the differential with the\npotential:   \n\n\n\n\nThe first term drops into the Euler-Lagrange equations to generate the Gauss\nand Ampere laws of electromagnetism. As a bonus, there is the Poynting vector,\nthe directional energy flux density of an electromagnetic field.\n\n\nRepresenting the compact Lie group needed to do spatial rotations is itself\ncompact when using quaternions:\n\n\n\n\nIf one tries to simply change from the cosine and sine function to the\nhyperbolic cosine and sine function, a member of the Lorentz group is not\ngenerated. This should not be a surprise since that group is not compact, a\nnon-trivial change. Other terms are required to pull off the trick:\n\n\n\n\nQuaternions provide another way to write these expressions. Nothing new is\nlearned, other than to be skeptical of claims about the limitations of\nquaternions.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n[1]  S. L. Adler. Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.

            "text": "quaternions  The homogeneous Maxwell equations are vector identities. They hold when\nwritten using quaternions. The Lagrange density used to derive the Maxwell\nsource equations is the difference of the squared magnetic and electric\nfields[5]:     The difference of two squares is the product of their sums and difference. The\nsimplest product of a quaternion differential operator and potential generates\nthe difference of the magnetic and electric fields:   This also has a gauge field g which can easily be eliminated by subtracting\nthe conjugate of this product. The sum of these two fields - times a factor of\nminus one - is formed by reversing the order of the differential with the\npotential:      The first term drops into the Euler-Lagrange equations to generate the Gauss\nand Ampere laws of electromagnetism. As a bonus, there is the Poynting vector,\nthe directional energy flux density of an electromagnetic field.  Representing the compact Lie group needed to do spatial rotations is itself\ncompact when using quaternions:   If one tries to simply change from the cosine and sine function to the\nhyperbolic cosine and sine function, a member of the Lorentz group is not\ngenerated. This should not be a surprise since that group is not compact, a\nnon-trivial change. Other terms are required to pull off the trick:   Quaternions provide another way to write these expressions. Nothing new is\nlearned, other than to be skeptical of claims about the limitations of\nquaternions.",

They are worked out for quaternions here in detail to\nsolidify the connection between the machinery of quantum mechanics and\nquaternions.\n\n\nThe conjugate of the square of the norm equals the square of the norm of the\ntwo terms reversed.\n\n\n\n\nFor quaternions,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are identical, because the terms involving the cross produce will flip\nsigns when their order changes.\n\n\nFor products of squares of norms in quantum mechanics,\n\n\n\n\nThis is also the case for quaternions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe triangle inequality in quantum mechanics:\n\n\n\n\nFor quaternions,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the signs of each pair of component are the same, the two sides will be\nequal.  If the signs are different (a t and a -t for example), then the cross\nterms will cancel on the left hand side of the inequality, making it smaller\nthan the right hand side where terms never cancel because there are only\nsquared terms.\n\n\nThe Schwarz inequality in quantum mechanics is analogous to dot products and\ncosines in Euclidean space.\n\n\n\n\nLet a third wave function, chi, be the sum of these two with an arbitrary\nparameter lambda.\n\n\n\n\nThe norm of chi will necessarily be greater than zero.\n\n\n\n\nChoose the value for lambda that helps combine all the terms containing\nlambda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiply through by the denominator, separate the two resulting terms and do\nsome minor rearranging.\n\n\n\n\nThis is now the Schwarz inequality.\n\n\nAnother inequality:\n\n\n\n\nExamine the square of the norm of the difference between two quaternions which\nis necessarily equal to or greater than zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cross terms can be put on the other side of inequality, changing the sign,\nand leaving the sum of two norms behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inequality holds.\n\n\nThe parallelogram law:\n\n\n\n\nTest the quaternion norm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is twice the square of the norms of the two separate components.\n\n\nImplications\n\n\nIn the case for special relativity, it was noticed that by simply squaring a\nquaternion, the resulting first term was the Lorentz invariant interval.  From\nthat solitary observation, the power of a mathematical field was harnessed to\nsolve a wide range of problems in special relativity.\n\n\nIn a similar fashion, it is hoped that because the product of a transpose of a\nquaternion with a quaternion has the properties of a complete inner product\nspace, the power of the mathematical field of quaternions can be used to solve\na wide range of problems in quantum mechanics.  This is an important area for\nfurther research.\n\n\nNote: this goal is different from the one Stephen Adler sets out in\n\"Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Fields.\"  He tries to substitute\nquaternions in the place of complex numbers in the standard Hilbert space\nformulation of quantum mechanics.  The analytical properties of quaternions do\nnot play a critical role.  It is the properties of the Hilbert space over the\nfield of quaternions that is harnessed to solve problems.  It is my opinion\nthat since the product of a transpose of a quaternion with a quaternion\nalready has the properties of a norm in a Hilbert space, there is no need to\nimbed quaternions again within another Hilbert space.

They are worked out for quaternions here in detail to\nsolidify the connection between the machinery of quantum mechanics and\nquaternions.  The conjugate of the square of the norm equals the square of the norm of the\ntwo terms reversed.   For quaternions,    These are identical, because the terms involving the cross produce will flip\nsigns when their order changes.  For products of squares of norms in quantum mechanics,   This is also the case for quaternions.         The triangle inequality in quantum mechanics:   For quaternions,        If the signs of each pair of component are the same, the two sides will be\nequal.  If the signs are different (a t and a -t for example), then the cross\nterms will cancel on the left hand side of the inequality, making it smaller\nthan the right hand side where terms never cancel because there are only\nsquared terms.  The Schwarz inequality in quantum mechanics is analogous to dot products and\ncosines in Euclidean space.   Let a third wave function, chi, be the sum of these two with an arbitrary\nparameter lambda.   The norm of chi will necessarily be greater than zero.   Choose the value for lambda that helps combine all the terms containing\nlambda.    Multiply through by the denominator, separate the two resulting terms and do\nsome minor rearranging.   This is now the Schwarz inequality.  Another inequality:   Examine the square of the norm of the difference between two quaternions which\nis necessarily equal to or greater than zero.    The cross terms can be put on the other side of inequality, changing the sign,\nand leaving the sum of two norms behind.    The inequality holds.

This involves using quaternion\nautomorphisms.  First a sketch of why this might work will be provided.\nSecond, small rotations in a plane around two axes will be used to show how\nthe resulting vector points in an opposite way, depending on which involution\nis used to construct the infinitesimal rotation.  Finally, a general identity\nwill be used to look at what happens under exchange of two quaternions in a\ncommutator.\n\n\nAutomorphism, Rotations, and Commutators\n\n\nQuaternions are formed from the direct product of a scalar and a 3-vector.\nRotational operators that act on each of the 3 components of the 3-vector act\nlike integral angular momentum.  I will show that a rotation operator that\nacts differently on two of the three components of the 3-vector acts like\nhalf-integral spin.  What happens with the scalar is irrelevant to this\ndimensional counting.  The same rotation matrix acting on the same quaternion\nbehaves differently depending directly on what involutions are involved.\n\n\nQuaternions have 4 degrees of freedom.  If we want to represent quaternions\nwith automorphisms, 4 are required:  They are the identity automorphism, the\nconjugate anti-automorphism, the first conjugate anti-automorphism, and the\nsecond conjugate anti-automorphism:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne1, e2, e3 are orthogonal basis vectors\n\n\nThe most important automorphism is the identity.  Life is stable around small\npermutations of the identity:-) The conjugate flips the signs of the each\ncomponent in the 3-vector.  These two automorphisms, the identity and the\nconjugate, treat the 3-vector as a unit.  The first and second conjugate flip\nthe signs of all terms but the first and second terms, respectively.\nTherefore these operators act on only the two of the three components in the\n3-vector.  By acting on only two of three components, a commutator will behave\ndifferently.  This small difference in behavior inside a commutator is what\ncreates the ability to represent integral and half-integral spins.\n\n\nSmall Rotations\n\n\nSmall rotations about the origin will now be calculated.  These will then be\nexpressed in terms of the four automorphisms discussed above.\n\n\nI will be following the approach used in J. J.

First, consider rotations about the origin in the z axis.\nDefine:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo technical points.  First, Sakurai considered rotations around any point\nalong the z axis.  This analysis is confined to the z axis at the origin, a\nsignificant but not unreasonable constraint.  Second, these rotations are\nwritten with generalized coordinates instead of the very familiar and\ncomfortable x, y, z.  This extra effort will be useful when considering how\nrotations are effected by curved spacetime.  This machinery is also necessary\nto do quaternion analysis (please see that section, it's great :-)\n\n\nThere are similar rotations around the first and second axes at the origin;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider an infinitesimal rotation for these three rotation operators.  To\nsecond order in theta,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the commutator of the first two infinitesimal rotation operators to\nsecond order in theta:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo second order, the commutator of infinitesimal rotations of rotations about\nthe first two axes equals twice one rotation about the third axis given the\nsquared angle minus a zero rotation about an arbitrary axis (a fancy way to\nsay the identity). Now I want to write this result using anti-automorphic\ninvolutions for the small rotation operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing has changed.  Repeat this exercise one last time for the first\nconjugate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis points exactly the opposite way,even for an infinitesimal angle!\n\n\nThis is the kernel required to form a unified representation of integral and\nhalf integral spin. Imagine adding up a series of these small rotations, say 2\npi of these.  No doubt the identity and conjugates will bring you back exactly\nwhere you started.  The first and second conjugates in the commutator will\npoint in the opposite direction.

The same rotation matrix acting on the same quaternion\nbehaves differently depending directly on what involutions are involved.  Quaternions have 4 degrees of freedom.  If we want to represent quaternions\nwith automorphisms, 4 are required:  They are the identity automorphism, the\nconjugate anti-automorphism, the first conjugate anti-automorphism, and the\nsecond conjugate anti-automorphism:      where    e1, e2, e3 are orthogonal basis vectors  The most important automorphism is the identity.

I will be following the approach used in J. J. Sakurai's book \"Modern Quantum\nMechanics\", chapter 3, making modifications necessary to accommodate\nquaternions.  First, consider rotations about the origin in the z axis.\nDefine:     Two technical points.  First, Sakurai considered rotations around any point\nalong the z axis.  This analysis is confined to the z axis at the origin, a\nsignificant but not unreasonable constraint.  Second, these rotations are\nwritten with generalized coordinates instead of the very familiar and\ncomfortable x, y, z.  This extra effort will be useful when considering how\nrotations are effected by curved spacetime.  This machinery is also necessary\nto do quaternion analysis (please see that section, it's great :-)  There are similar rotations around the first and second axes at the origin;    Consider an infinitesimal rotation for these three rotation operators.  To\nsecond order in theta,      Calculate the commutator of the first two infinitesimal rotation operators to\nsecond order in theta:      To second order, the commutator of infinitesimal rotations of rotations about\nthe first two axes equals twice one rotation about the third axis given the\nsquared angle minus a zero rotation about an arbitrary axis (a fancy way to\nsay the identity).

Repeat this exercise one last time for the first\nconjugate:      This points exactly the opposite way,even for an infinitesimal angle!

Since the structure of the operator is\nidentical to the previous one, instead of the D'Alembertian times the wave\nfunction, there is En 2 -Pn 2 .  The sum of all these terms becomes m 2 .

I view that as my \"born \nagain\" moment, one based on physics, not the Bible. For a month long period, my \nmind kept rearranging information, sure that everything somehow made sense. I \nwas aware I was babbling - saying words that are part of the lexicon of \nphysics, but would not make sense to an actual physicist. I decide to keep a \nday job, but work study physics in the background.\n\n\nBoston was the perfect city in the 1990s to study physics on the side. I took a \nHarvard Extension class on Special Relativity taught by Edwin F. Taylor as he \nwas writing the book \"Spacetime Physics\" with Johnathon Wheeler. Taylor would \nbring in a new chapter from Copy Copy, and we were assigned to critique it.\n\nThus became my respectful skeptical analysis of physics. I decide to keep a day \njob, but work study physics in the background.\n\n\nI was able to show some of my earliest efforts to a famous physicist who worked \nat MIT. He said it was \"interesting, but not very interesting\". The reason was \nI did not have a theory, a means to make many calculations. At the time, all I \nhad were a few math widgets.\n\n\nFirst work on quaternions\n\n\nIn the struggle to find a theory, I held a small contest on a moderated \nnewsgroup, sci.physics.research in 1997. I asked readers to provide a brief \ndefinition of time. It had to be about math or physics, not philosophy, and \nneeded to be two sentences or less. In one math book, I recalled some odd sort \nof number that was like a scalar and a vector. The contest motivated me to \nreread that passage, then go to an old-fashion library and read up about \nquaternions. This was the first equation I saw, the squaring of a quaternion:\n\n\n\n\nTo this day, this makes me excited because the first term is at the core of \nspecial relativity as taught to me by Edwin F. Taylor. It is there, for free.\n\nThat cannot be an accident. That observation drove me to purchase the domain \nquaternions.com.\n\n\nMajor failure at a unified field theory\n\n\nI struggled to come up with a way to deal with gravity using only quaternions.\n\nOne lesson from general relativity is that a theory of gravity must be a metric \ntheory - a theory where the calculation of distance depends on where one \nhappens to be in a gravitational field. Measuring distance is a symmetric \noperation, meaning there is no handed to doing the work. Quaternions do have a \nhandedness. There is no way around that. So I reinvented hypercomplex numbers.\n\nThose have all the same multiplication rules as quaternions, but no minus signs \nanywhere. As such, hypercomplex numbers could be used to characterize a metric.\n\n\nI confess to having pride in the proposal, enough to print up t-shirts. It was \ndifficult to find a professional to review the body of work. I began blogging \non Science20.com. There I found a few technically skilled readers. When I \nfinally got to presenting what I called the GEM proposal, several readers \nobjected to the work. It took a little over a month for me to really see the \nproposal like they did. The flaw was deadly. A Lagrangian constructed from \nquaternions will not change under a rotation. It will therefore conserve \nangular momentum. A Lagrangian constructed from hypercomplex numbers will \nchange under a rotation. It will not conserve angular momentum. Kepler's law of \nequal area in equal time is a statement that gravity conserves angular \nmomentum. Thus a proposal for gravity using hypercomplex number in the \nLagrangian is wrong. End of story.\n\n\nCurrent research\n\n\nWeb sites:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaternions.com\n, the mothership of my private\n  research project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers 101\n, a visual introduction to space-time\n  numbers, aka quaternions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement 101\n, a site dedicated to my new proposal \nfor quaternion gravity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualPhysics.org\n has a collection of analytic \n  animations generated with a user-hostile set of tools I wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaternion space-times-time invariance as gravity\n\n\nI went back to the equation that sparked my initial interest in quaternions:\n\n\n\n\nThe first term is called the interval.

That is a problem because the first term is one of \nthe most important in physics because it is at the heart of special relativity.\n\nI came up with a reasonable name for the three amigos: space-times-time. I \nasked a simple question: what if space-times-time was invariant, then what sort \nof physics results? That could be gravity, but a very different theory because \nit is not a field theory.
