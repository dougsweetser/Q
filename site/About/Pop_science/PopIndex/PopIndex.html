</FONT></P>

<P>Van Gogh, Magritte and Warhol meet Einstein, Feynman, and Hawking in an attempt 
  to shift the foundations of physics. By developing a visual vocabulary that 
  is tightly linked to the mathematics of physics, new insights are gained. Form, 
  color and contrast are used to expand the palette of physics which is currently 
  constrained to simple stick drawings. Historically, artists have told religious 
  stories often relying on triptychs to gain different perspectives. To explain 
  these tall tales from deep physics, I have relied on triptychs to walk around 
  concepts visually.</P>

<P>Progress in the logic of science happens when firmly established ideas must 
  dance with new partners to recreate the footprints left on the floor by experiments. 
  The technical narrative behind each piece is presented with accompanying text. 
  The first section, &quot;For Folks&quot;, is targeted for a general audience. 
  No knowledge of the issues is presumed. In contrast, the section &quot;For Nerds&quot; 
  is intended for people with a technical knowledge of physics. The text forms 
  its own diptych between physicists and the general public.<BR>

<P ALIGN="Center"><FONT SIZE="+2"><A NAME="goals"> The Goals of the Pop Science Project</a></FONT></p>

<P>The PoP science project has three goals. The first goal is to explain some 
  of the trickiest ideas and experiments ever developed in physics to a general 
  audience. Any difficulty in understanding a piece lies in the difficulty in 
  understanding the scientific idea behind it, which may come from special relativity 
  (the physics of going fast), general relativity (the physics of gravity), or 
  quantum mechanics (the physics of wavy clumps of particles).</P>

<P>The second goal is to present new perspectives about physics to nerds. In these 
  works, there are new, useful observations and equations for professional physicists. 
  These works do not yet constitute a theory, a completely coherent system of 
  logic. Rather, the collection is like quantum mechanics in 1924, not a theory, 
  but a collection of new, useful observations and equations. The artist is interested 
  in establishing collaborations with physicists willing to work on the task of 
  building a theory from a set of curiosities.</P>

<P>The third goal is to build a body of art work suitable for presentation at a university museum.  The tension of an open and lively discussion of the ideas behind these works could help to pull this intellectual sled forward.</P>
